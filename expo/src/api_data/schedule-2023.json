The workshop starts off with an introduction to GraphQL API federation, where students will learn about the power and flexibility of GraphQL and its federation capabilities. Then the teams will be formed, and the competition scenario will be revealed—finding Carmen San Diego! Each team will create their own HQ and extend the federated graph, adding new services, connections, and data sources to gather clues and track down Carmen. They can also try to thwart other teams by giving them false clues. Real-time collaboration and problem-solving will be crucial to stay ahead. Join us for an unforgettable workshop that brings together technology and adventure, all while honing your GraphQL expertise. Can your team solve the mystery and emerge as the ultimate Carmen San Diego catchers? The race is on!",

And even run it all on the client side\nIn this workshop, we will go through the many novel ideas behind GraphQL Mesh, see them in action and learn how to use this complete API platform today on your existing codebase.\n\nWe will leave time for an open Q&A session where we can talk in-depth about your current setups and how you could leverage The Guild's ecosystem of tools.",

GraphQL provides a consistent API for clients, but it's expensive to build and operate distinct GraphQL servers. Developers are often required to write custom code to provide platform features like security, caching, and resilience. What if there were another way? What if you could meld GraphQL server capabilities into an Envoy gateway without separate server deployments? And without disturbing upstream application services? In this fast-paced, hands-on workshop, every attendee can use their own sandboxed environment to explore these topics together: • Discovery: Inspect existing service contracts and derive GraphQL schema. • Declarative: Create IaC resolvers that consume OpenAPI services. • Stitching: Execute GraphQL queries across multiple services with a unified supergraph. • Gateway Integration: Use declarative policies to mix in gateway features like authNZ and data loss prevention. Buckle your seat belts! This Wild Ride will help you accelerate GraphQL adoption using infrastructure-as-code principles in a cloud-native environment.",

With the potential for more choices and complexity introduced by React Server Components, is it possible to avoid “analysis paralysis” due to more options? In this 1-2 hour workshop, we will explore a new workflow for dynamic full-stack applications using React Server Components (RSC) and GraphQL. Our focus will be on how RSC and GraphQL can co-exist and complement each other, allowing data to flow through your application and enabling it to scale and evolve as more features are added. We will cover server-side fetching with React Server components, how to use Redwood cells, and migrating to fragments. Additionally, we’ll review GraphQL fundamentals inside Redwood, including security concerns and best practices, directives, and authentication. You’ll leave this workshop with a workflow and process for designing and building full-stack applications in Redwood with scalability and simplicity.",

    "description": "As the adoption of GraphQL has grown, so too have the prevailing patterns for how GraphQL APIs are developed and deployed. Gone are the days where every GraphQL API was a development task to code, deploy, and manage GraphQL middleware connected to your data sources. Increasingly, GraphQL is supported as a native API for data sources, integrated directly in gateway routers and application sidecars, and provided directly in edge compute platforms and CDN providers. While this level of optimization is common as application protocols and languages reach widespread adoption, it’s critically important to understand the best practices and patterns for how GraphQL should be used at each layer of your application networking architecture. This talk will provide a survey of existing and emerging trends for application networking architectures with GraphQL, providing concrete examples and advice on how to build scalable and performant architectures for your GraphQL APIs.",

GraphQL, as a groundbreaking data query language and API, is ideally positioned to support such principles.\n\nIn this talk, we will provide an overview of FAIR and open the discussion around potential integration and synergies with GraphQL to help turn the FAIR vision into reality. Such integration would also expose GraphQL to new audiences and drive its adoption.\n\nAs a bonus topic, we will also explore the potential relationship and synergies between GraphQL and SPARQL, the RDF Query Language, such as exposing SPARQL endpoints as GraphQL APIs and integrating semantic RDF data into the GraphQL data graph.",

This groundbreaking research, involving a scan of over 1500 GraphQL endpoints, revealed a staggering 46,000+ security issues and sensitive data leaks, all accessible without authentication and with 10% classified as critical. In this session, Tristan and Antoine will share their unique testing methodology and delve into the most common GraphQL vulnerabilities unearthed during their research. They'll expose GraphQL-specific vulnerabilities, including complexity issues and schema leaks, alongside persistent standard API security threats like injections and server errors. They'll also highlight the often-underestimated problem of data leaks, including sensitive personal information and tokens. But, they won't leave you in the trenches; they'll showcase practical remediation strategies, introducing tools like GraphQL Armor and a handy security checklist for developers. Don't miss this crucial session at the GraphQL Conf 2023.",

Choose compelling design goals for a serialization format Build up a format with distinct advantages over JSON Compare and analyze the practical tradeoffs between JSON and a purpose-built format By the end of the session, we will have built up to Argo: a compact and compressible binary serialization format for GraphQL. After the session, more details can be found in Argo’s open source specification, design notes, and reference implementation.\nThis talk assumes significant familiarity with GraphQL (particularly the Schema Definition Language) and JSON.\nSee Argo on GitHub, Argo homepage (including link to Argo spec), or Mike's website.",

Attendees will learn about the key components required to develop a well-defined and well-governed API program, including API specifications, governance and consistency, dev community & help, and closed-loop feedback. While there are a lot of guidelines and best practices for REST APIs in the industry, there are not yet as many guidelines for GraphQL. Intuit made over 56 million transactions with GraphQL over the 2023 tax peak season, and that number will only get larger from here. GraphQL adoption at this scale required us to build a robust API program with a centralized set of guidelines on how the schema should be composed, along with a community-driven review process and a firm but flexible governance framework. In this session, we will share insights and lessons learned using real-life examples from our GraphQL API Program, enabling attendees to apply these learnings to their own businesses. This session offers a valuable opportunity for businesses to develop their API programs and stay competitive.",

With the launch of recent missions, CMR's usage has increased exponentially; this usage and the features added to support new capabilities have made it increasingly difficult to keep it's response formats and capabilities consistent and performant. Unfortunately agency requirements and existing CMR client implementations limit our ability to change our APIs. In our research for a solution that would allow us to work within these limitations, the use of GraphQL as an abstraction layer would mean that our existing APIs could remain unchanged. Additionally, this would allow us to offer new functionality via a self-documenting, specification based approach. Our introduction of GraphQL has allowed us to normalize the ways that users communicate with our APIs and enabled us to make changes to our core APIs with no impact to clients. In this talk, I'll discuss the challenges, wins, losses, and lessons learned in wrapping CMR's API with GraphQL and how it's being utilized today.",

It has been an incredible learning experience, and it has been very rewarding to meet the engineers using the library all over the world. But it wasn’t always an open source fairytale!

Within the world of web3 there are many different ways to use smart contracts, so Subgraphs are modular APIs enabling developers to build for any use case. These subgraphs can be queried via The Graph, a decentralized network for accessing blockchain data.\n\nIn this presentation we will explore: Practical aspects of accessing blockchain data using Subgraphs, including the basics of building a GraphQL schema Discuss efficient Data optimization Utility of GraphQL for blockchain data Elements of decentralization and data\nLearn how Subgraphs simplify the data extraction from blockchains, optimize data handling, and enhance query flexibility. Join us to understand how these elements work together to make blockchain data more accessible and manageable.",

    "description": "Over the past decade of GraphQL, many implementations have emerged from the community, primarily that of imperative approaches to GraphQL. However, recently we have seen an uptick in implementations that allow for declarative configuration of GraphQL schemas and resolvers. These declarative approaches offer new possibilities in terms of managing and scaling GraphQL APIs. In this talk, we will dive into the challenges of implementing a declarative API for GraphQL and explore the solutions that exist in the ecosystem. Firstly, we will introduce several prominent solutions that enable declarative configuration of GraphQL APIs, such as Gloo GraphQL, GraphQL Mesh, and StepZen. We will compare and contrast these solutions, highlighting their unique features, capabilities, and integration possibilities with existing infrastructure. We will then delve into the more technical aspects and challenges of implementing a highly performant GraphQL server that we built-in as a component of the industry standard Envoy proxy. By the end of this talk, attendees will be left with a comprehensive understanding of declarative GraphQL and the solutions available in the ecosystem.",

Here, we will discuss the challenges and issues that led us here, our motivation for replacing Apollo Uplink as the single source of truth for our supergraph schemas, the alternative solutions we considered, and, finally, why we decided to take the path that we did--essentially reinventing the wheel--and where we plan to take it going forward. Attendees will leave with a deep understanding of the tradeoffs with respect to managed federation in mission critical environments, specifically as they relate to use of Apollo's Uplink service as a single source of truth. Moreover, attendees will walk away with a general plan for how to mitigate the challenges and limitations above, using Mission Control as the seminal example.",

    "description": "According to Gartner, GraphQL was implemented in just over 10% of enterprises in 2021 and they predict that GraphQL implementations will increase to over 50% of all enterprises by 2025.\n\nThe unprecedented surge in GraphQL’s popularity within enterprise ecosystems calls for an urgent introspective analysis and forward-thinking strategies. This panel discussion delves into the foreseeable future, envisioning GraphQL’s evolution by 2025 in response to expanding horizons, AI integration, and the embrace of contemporary programming languages.\n\nAs GraphQL cements its position as an indispensable tool in enterprise architectures, the necessity for the project to evolve rapidly without compromising consistency becomes apparent. Our esteemed panelists will shed light on the innovations and adaptations necessary for the GraphQL project to flourish. This includes a discussion on evolving governance models, project sustainability, and community engagement to ensure the GraphQL Foundation remains a steward of progress.\n\nAnother focal point is the emergence of AI in API ecosystems. How can GraphQL integrate with AI-driven systems? What challenges and opportunities does AI present for GraphQL APIs? Our experts will discuss the promising avenues where GraphQL and AI can complement each other, and how this synergy could redefine data-fetching paradigms.\n\nAdditionally, the panel will tackle the inevitable shift toward modern programming languages. With languages such as Rust, Kotlin, and Swift gaining traction, the GraphQL ecosystem must adapt. We’ll discuss the opportunities these languages present and how GraphQL can harness their strengths to remain a versatile and powerful tool for contemporary development.\n\nThe final segment will engage the audience in a thought-provoking dialogue on the GraphQL Foundation’s role in these evolving landscapes. Panelists will offer perspectives on what's next for the GraphQL Foundation from today through 2025.",

    "description": "Good tools help get a job done faster and better. Great tools transform the entire end-to-end workflow from concept to deployment. GraphQL, an open standard and protocol for APIs, is both good and great. It allows your designer to explore the full capabilities of your data so they can conceive of the best user experience possible. GraphQL allows your engineers to say “three weeks” to your product manager where they would have said “two months” before. These enhancements have a practical impact on the relationships that are the foundation of your cross-functional team’s success. In this talk I’ll address some of the challenges product teams face as their understanding of the end user starts to outpace their ability to ship new features (which is healthy). Then, I will give some concrete examples where GraphQL can make a difference. A/B tests and designer productivity will be covered, all drawn from my experiences in both IC and EM roles on product engineering teams. For each of these scenarios I’ll show how GraphQL principles and tooling can give your team a practical advantage.",

We’ve had failures and successes, and lots of learning along the way.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll dive deep into the following topics:\n- Out-Of-The-Box Tooling (Nock, MSW, Relay MockPayloadGenerator, graphql-tools/mock)\n- Custom Helpers (Operation Mocking, Data Component Wrappers, Network Middleware)\n- Client Side Data Manipulation (Mocking Single Fields, Client Schema Extensions)\n- Storybook (Loading Live/Mocked Data, Update Field Mocks Dynamically)",

    "description": "Typically, GraphQL schemas are constructed statically, and services will expose one or a set number of schemas depending on the roles of clients that query the system. When the system is highly configurable, allowing the creation of new types and fields at runtime, with different types and fields exposed depending on the clients privileges, building a set of static schemas becomes infeasible. This talk will discuss a technique used to construct types and fields at runtime, reflecting the users level of access within the system. This technique allowed us to scale to millions of schemas which reflected the permissions of the client querying the GraphQL endpoint. I will discuss the interplay between the static parts of the schema available to all clients and the dynamic parts built depending on the users privileges, as well as how to represent this structure with a \"metaschema\". Then, I'll demonstrate a pattern for constructing types at runtime, with a service responsible for safe instantiation that honors the GraphQL spec, interacting with a set of actors that control which types should be instantiated. I'll close with some discussion of how the spec impacts dynamic construction.",

But understanding exactly how these actors go about recognizing where your GraphQL APIs reside—and how their attacks proceed—can put you on the right road to attack-thwarting countermeasures. GraphQL’s declarative query language enables clients to collect information using specialized queries. Threat actors commonly interrogate APIs in order to uncover critical information that could aid in further attacks. These information-gathering and reconnaissance tactics feed into the logic of their scanning tools to determine the location of GraphQL APIs—and what they contain. Session attendees will come away with thorough knowledge of how to detect and mitigate nefarious GraphQL activities, and how to implement a security layer to protect targeted GraphQL APIs and effectively block attacks. Attendees of this GraphQLConf talk will learn: -- The techniques attackers use to gather information on your GraphQL APIs -- The telltale anomalous behavior associated with that reconnaissance, and -- How to surface threats and block those attack paths before exploits occur.",

    "description": "When designing a GraphQL schema, it’s tempting to mark every field as non-null using the \"!\" operator. While it may seem convenient and simplifies code readability, this seemingly innocuous choice can have unforeseen consequences for your applications, especially during service disruptions. Moreover, these downsides might not become apparent until a significant portion of your schema has been marked as non-nullable. In this talk, we will: - Challenge the traditional server-centric approach and advocate for shifting the responsibility of field nullability to the client. - Explore the reasons behind this paradigm shift and introduce existing and upcoming tools that empower clients to determine whether a field can be null or not. - Delve into the Client Controlled Nullability proposal, demonstrating its potential in GraphQL workflows. - Provide practical methods and best practices to safely migrate away from a non-null schema, ensuring compatibility with existing clients without causing disruptions.",

    "description": "There is a bright future for AI-driven integration, both in the application of integration to provide access to enterprise data for use by AI tools and also for application of AI to benefit the delivery of integration scenarios. However, AI foundation models must be complemented by integration and API technologies, and GraphQL can be the perfect technology for this. Having founded StepZen (now acquired by IBM) I have a particular bias for GraphQL applications, but in this case they can be especially powerful. AI applications can be trained to call one universal GraphQL API, and not have to deal with the subtleties of formats and authorizations and sideways information passing if the application were to learn multiple backends. In this talk I’ll explain why AI needs GraphQL for integrations, and what the future of AI and GraphQL looks like.",

This service, owned by a small team, exploded in use receiving countless contributions across the company. We soon realised as a team this would not scale for an entire company.\n\nThis talk focuses on our experience and our journey from our first steps into the world of GraphQL and then our leap to move to a Federated GraphQL layer.\n\nWe will share some of our most important learnings from the challenges we faced, including scaling and resiliency, bringing on legacy services, and multi cloud support and how we are handling these challenges via our ongoing initiatives and what we think the future of GraphQL at Booking.com looks like.",

GraphQL has gained popularity as a modern API technology that enables developers to build APIs that are flexible, performant, and easy to use. However, one of the challenges of using GraphQL is deciding whether to use a schema-first or a code-first approach.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss how code-first allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability in GraphQL API development. We'll explore how it can improve the development process, especially for large teams and complex projects. By using code-first, developers can write code that generates the schema, which provides greater control over the API design and allows for more efficient iteration.Moreover, we'll examine how Strawberry, a GraphQL library built on Python, leverages the power of Python's type system to provide an end-to-end type-safe code-first approach. This approach allows developers to define their GraphQL schema using Python classes, which Strawberry then converts into a GraphQL schema, ensuring type safety throughout the development process.",
