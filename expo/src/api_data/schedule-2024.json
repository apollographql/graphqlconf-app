The primary mission of the GraphQL Foundation is to ensure that the GraphQL community is able to focus on the continued evolution of the specification, the shared contract that competitors and collaborators alike implement to enable maximal interoperability. This talk is to thank YOU, the GraphQL community, and highlight some of the heroes that have arisen to heed this call. Find out about their efforts over the last year improving our shared specifications, implementations, documentation, tooling, tests, and websites; about how you can get involved and help shape GraphQL to fit your organization's needs; about the support we have available; and about other community initiatives you may wish to avail yourself of.",

In this talk I will explain the general idea that we have for GraphQL as an Orchestrator in this space and how the new specification is tackling this. We will look at the progress we have made since last GraphQL Conf in the GraphQL composite schema working group and also get some sneak peaks at our early RFCs and prototypes. I will outline how this new specification is taking the best ideas of existing solutions in the market to make the next big leap towards mainstream adoption. This will allow anyone to build tooling by implementing the spec or parts of the spec that seamlessly integrate with other vendors.",

Topics we'll cover:\nRapid Prototyping: Techniques for quickly generating efficient and extensible APIs. Advanced Data Integration: Strategies for seamlessly joining and managing data from disparate sources. Extreme Flexibility: Extension points that let you customise the generated API and completely override how it works without rebuilding it. Robust Security: Tools to protect the data in the API with advanced role-based access control and more.

    "description": "GraphQL is agnostic to the transport layer. Almost all out of the box observability tooling is tailored to REST/HTTP APIs. Major observability challenge with GraphQL over HTTP is the support of partial response and HTTP status with 2XX may have failed. GraphQL Gateway generally fans-out one incoming request to one or many outgoing subgraph requests. It is essential to monitor each subgraph and the GraphQL gateway’s metrics and also to trace a single request across the network stack. This talk will cover how Intuit is reducing Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) for GraphQL APIs, by capturing Failed Customer Interactions, Golden Signal to determine gateway and subgraph’s health, latency, error rate and other related metrics. This talk will also cover open tracing and logging for GraphQL APIs.",

    "description": "At last year’s GraphQL Conf, Stephanie Saunders sang the praises of schema mocking in her excellent talk “Sophisticated Schema Mocking”. As Stephanie outlined, tests written using mock schemas have several benefits over ones written with static response mocks (seriously, go back and watch the talk if you haven’t!) Mock schemas are the perfect pair for Mock Service Worker which describes itself as “an API mocking library that allows you to write client-agnostic mocks and reuse them across any frameworks, tools, and environments.” In this talk, I’ll demonstrate how to use mock schemas with MSW using testing tools created by the Apollo Client team. These utilities can be used with any GraphQL client for the web whether it’s Apollo Client, Relay, urql, isograph or even just plain fetch requests to a GraphQL endpoint, and support incremental delivery (@defer/@stream), subscriptions and more. With MSW + your front-end stack of choice + test runner or framework of choice (Jest, Puppeteer, Cypress, Storybook, the list goes on) this talk will teach you how to level up the tests you and your team are writing.",

With its ecosystem maturing--the ability to deploy with multiple cloud providers, the standardization of WebAssembly Components, and the rise of WASI--its potential is fast becoming a reality. WebAssembly is especially suitable for running server-side code at the edge, where resource constraints and security concerns are paramount. To realize the full potential of running API servers at the edge--lowered latency, reduced costs, and improved scalability--we must rethink our approach to building and deploying servers. GraphQL is particularly well-suited for edge deployments. It not only reduces the number of trips between the client and the server but also allows implementations to optimize the whole query to reduce round trips to the data server. In this session, we will explore how to target a Rust implementation of GraphQL server to WebAssembly. We'll also look into how this fits within the WebAssembly ecosystem and how you can run these servers even in your browser.",

    "description": "Pinterest is too large to simply “rewrite our app” to use GraphQL in one fell swoop. Even migrating an individual screen takes months, at our scale this is quite challenging, like changing a plane’s engine while flying. Is GraphQL adoption destined to be difficult for large companies? Can this process be made more incremental? Unfortunately, the answer seems to be no. It's hard to imagine how components consuming GraphQL data can coexist on a page that makes network requests to a REST endpoint. And yet, we figured it out. And we had a good time, too! We designed Relay-compatible APIs that allow us to read data either from a GraphQL store or from arbitrary objects (e.g. from Redux.) So, engineers can migrate individual components within a larger tree. These components specify the data they need using a fragment, and receive GraphQL-shaped data, regardless of whether the data came from GraphQL or REST. When a component tree is fully migrated, we're able to A/B test the REST and GraphQL endpoints, and only turn on GraphQL when we're sure doing so won't degrade any metrics. And we're about to release this to open source: adopting GraphQL on the front-end has never been easier!",

This session will show you what you can do to never let this happen again, ever! We will start by analysing why it is so easy to do a breaking change in a GraphQL API, what this even means and how to prevent it. Then, we will explore the issues that come once a client application uses your GraphQL API, learn effective ways to prevent the issues from happening and how to apply it in real world complexities. Learn to build resilient GraphQL APIs - today.",

Running an autonomous fleet of vehicles requires access to real-time and low-latency telematic data. This data needs to be made accessible to our users on a fleet map to always have a detailed overview of the current fleet state. Using only queries and polling we quickly ran into scalability issues and had to rethink our approach. Therefore we went to the drawing board and designed and built a serverless architecture on top of AWS and GraphQL over WebSocket to support our stream-aligned teams in building serverless subscriptions in a microservice environment. Watch a replay of our journey enabling other teams to effortlessly push updates to their users using a shared subscription gateway.",

    "description": "Two aspects of resolvers have an outsized influence on their performance: the size of the execution context, and the way we compute their value. In the Node.js implementation of graphql, promises wrapping primitive values are especially disruptive, since they add a large computing overhead. The context size creates a memory usage baseline that can rise very quickly with even small additions to the context, when there are many concurrent contexts. The execution can create temporary objects, increasing memory usage. Often-run resolvers, such as those responsible for filling out large arrays of objects, can become performance bottlenecks. At Auction.com, our search results page (SRP) requests up to 500 items of roughly 80 fields each. The query resolving these fields was suffering a high latency. We shall examine the tools to instrument our code and identify memory usage and CPU utilization bottlenecks. Our realtime elements (e.g. realtime updates to the status of currently viewed properties) are implemented using a translation of kafka messages to graphql updates. We shall present the tools and procedures to reduce memory usage and CPU usage when fanning out such messages.",

Many developers are starting to use GraphQL to provide a monolithic facade on top of their complex microservice architecture. In turn, making their next-generation APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly.\nBut using GraphQL also introduces many new challenges when isolating failures and troubleshooting performance issues. Can OpenTelemetry help solve those challenges?\n\nDuring this talk, we will:\n1. Give a brief overview of OpenTelemetry as a technology\n2. Investigate common challenges developers and SREs might encounter when running GraphQL in production\n3. Explore how OpenTelemetry can help deal with these issues\n4. Discuss what needs to be improved to make OTel even more valuable for the community",

    "description": "Many of the most common issues developers run into when building GraphQL APIs (N+1 queries, difficult authorization logic, protecting against arbitrary query complexity) come down to a single problem: when an untrusted client can construct arbitrary queries, lots can go wrong. So what if they just couldn't? The wins of GraphQL aren't in letting *clients* build their own queries but in letting *client developers* build their own queries. When Firebase chose GraphQL as the basis for its new Data Connect product, we introduced \"Connectors\", a new resource type that bundles a group of predefined GraphQL queries and mutations and exposes them at an endpoint. While trusted servers can execute arbitrary queries, untrusted clients can only use predefined queries and mutations. This approach substantially simplifies the security model of building with GraphQL. Rather than worrying about every possible query, you can build authorization and complexity mechanics around well-known predefined queries. Learn the how, the why, and the possible future of \"Connectors\" for GraphQL in Firebase and beyond.",

Coming from an established enterprise organization with over 800 engineers, who work predominantly with REST, we had a big challenge rolling out our federated GraphQL ambitions at scale in a distributed (micro)service landscape. Besides tech, our journey was also about changing how people work, building expertise and create a strong GraphQL community, for both engineers and product, and getting them invested in our GraphQL journey. We will share with you our hurdles, lessons learned and painful roadblocks and share with you what we wish we knew when we started, so you are well prepared when you start your own GraphQL adoption journey at scale after this talk.",

    "description": "In this talk, I will go through two recent experiments at Meta where we improved Application scroll perf (commonly known as frame drops) and media stalls by developing advanced GraphQL features. 1. Batched @defers. Common UI update cycles with regular defers will introduce increased state updates and may cause unnecessary re-renders. By batching deferred payloads carefully, we can achieved improved latency without introduce frame drops which is commonly associated with decreased engagement. 2. Improved CDN prefetch. Most of the time, the bottleneck to TTI is the media loads, either image load or video load. Commonly, Applications prefetch these media from CDN to improve stalls. We can make the prefetch better by using the visitor pattern which is available in many GraphQL library to enable prefetch during parsing time.",

This means we let our implementations drive our GraphQL schema. However, our developers have a growing appetite to agree on our schema up front before diving into implementation. This talk will explore how we shifted our architecture to use a schema-first approach within a code-first framework. \n \nOverall, I aim to dispel the notion that using a code-first solution prevents us from defining schema as a first step. I will explore the advantages of doing schema review at scale, as well as highlight an open source GraphQL-Codegen plugin we built to generate Kotlin classes and interfaces from our schema definitions. \n \nI am eager to contribute to the conversation around schema-first vs code-first, which has been the topic of several GraphQLConf talks over the past few years. This approach brings a fresh perspective and should inspire folks to incorporate a schema-first mentality into their GraphQL development cycle.",

    "description": "In this talk, we'll explore the future of GraphQL and why its success hinges on our collective ability to address the elephant in the room of governance.\n\nDespite its popularity among developers due to its flexibility and efficiency, GraphQL has yet to fully win over enterprise architects. Their world revolves around REST, model-first abstractions, data lineage, and rigorous compliance standards. To truly gain their trust and drive broader adoption in the enterprise, I'll argue that GraphQL implementations must be metadata-driven, with an emphasis on configuration over code.\n\nHowever, all is not lost! In today’s enterprise landscape, the domain model is predicated on the principle that the teams who own the data should also be responsible for managing it and making it available through agnostic channels. With this in mind, GraphQL is uniquely positioned to excel, thanks to its capabilities in federation and schema stitching. These features enable a paradigm that scales both technically and, more importantly, organizationally, aligning with the goals of managing traceability, lineage, and compliance in a manner that satisfies regulatory demands.\n\nIn this session, we'll delve into how the future of GraphQL, much like the stability of any nation, is rooted in good governance. We'll examine the priorities of enterprise architects and demonstrate how a governance-focused approach can help GraphQL evolve into a robust data access layer within any business.",

The flexibility and expressiveness provided by a GraphQL schema seems to be a perfect fit for use with type-safe coding languages. But there are many challenges to overcome when consuming a GraphQL schema in strictly type-safe languages. This talk will discuss why GraphQL seems to conflict with type safety; explore some of the notable challenges GraphQL client developers face when consuming a GraphQL API; and uncover how the Apollo team has approached solutions for many of these issues in Swift and the Apollo iOS client.",

In September 2016, when our team of ten-odd full-stack engineers adopted GraphQL, we were handling a few thousand requests per second on our GraphQL layer. Fast forward to 2023, the engineering team has grown to 1,000 members managing half a billion requests per minute at peak. In this talk we aim to address critical questions regarding GraphQL's performance, when is the right time to integrate it, exploring whether GraphQL is predominantly a front-end abstraction or if it can also be effectively utilized in back-end operations for service-to-service communication. Drawing from years of extensive GraphQL usage at a significant scale—without the need for federation—we will introduce for the first time an open-source project that helped us elegantly design, streamline, and scale optimal GraphQL APIs.",

    "description": "In this session - we’ll explore how GraphQL Clients can provide a road for developers to make full use of Semantic Nullability! GraphQL Spec defines that field errors should result in a null value. This makes null values ambiguous - either null due to error - or null due to nullability. Semantic Nullability allows you to define nullability explicitly - see https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/discussions/1410 Therefore, GraphQL Clients need to be able to handle errors differently - giving engineers more confidence in how field states are handled. In this session, we'll cover: 1. Why explicitly handling errors can enable us to move to a new normal where all errors are surfaced explicitly (throw-by-default on error) 2. How using @catch directive allows us to differentiate error nulls from true nulls in product code 3. Steps 1 and 2 will require developers to handle errors explicitly - and this opens the door to Semantic Nullability! I’ll also cover how working on the @catch directive helped push the semantic nullability conversation forward, the rollout at Meta, and what future capabilities can be unlocked.

The talk will cover architecture, technologies, process and an overview of our application. We have moved significant portions of our application from a legacy database management and application framework to a modern relational database with a microservice business logic layer and a single page application client. GraphQL is used to tie the application, data and business logic together in a single API that is shared across multiple applications and modules. The initial approach has evolved into a platform for building applications that host complex data and business logic. We are also evolving our architecture to deliver data from our applications directly to legislative branch partners over a GraphQL endpoint, replacing multiple legacy delivery methods.",

In this talk, I will look at various implementations of implementation-first and explain why Facebook chose this approach to build their own GraphQL server and why it is actually the better approach in most projects.",

    "description": "Discovering GraphQL fields and generating queries is a tedious task for developers. They spend a considerable amount of time finding the appropriate fields in large schemas. To solve this problem at Intuit where we have a super graph consisting of millions of lines we implemented a framework that makes use of Generative AI to help developers with attribute discovery and query generation. The benefits of our approach include being able to work with large schemas without the hassle of going through the whole schema and requiring less back and forth communication between consumers and schema owners, which results in a huge boost in developer productivity. We created chunks of the schema and ingested them into a vector store, we then do a retrieval, dynamically build a minimal schema and perform RAG where the LLM is provided with the minimal schema and the user query. The LLM responds with either a list of discovered attributes or GraphQL query. This framework aims to achieve lower latency and less hallucinations by reducing the size of the schema sent to the LLM, this also results in lower costs and higher accuracy.",

    "description": "We will explore the revolutionary integration of GraphQL with the Oracle Database in this session. The way developers query and interact with the database has been greatly simplified by this integration. We will introduce the concept of Duality Views, a brand-new feature available in Oracle Database 23ai. Using Duality Views, data is still stored in relational tables in a highly efficient normalized format but is accessed by apps in the form of JSON documents. Duality Views are created using an intuitive and flexible GraphQL-like syntax, enhancing developer productivity. \n \nWe will also demonstrate new capabilities in the database to automatically infer the GraphQL schema from existing relational schemas, making it easy to introspect and visualize the relational schema as well as write GraphQL queries against the database. Finally, we will talk about new GraphQL directives to allow calculations, reshaping, and transformations in a GraphQL query that can be executed on a relational database. \n \nCome learn how Oracle's support for GraphQL is transforming data access and providing a powerful and seamless solution for modern application development.",

I hope to inspire DevEx teams and Technical Writers to consider GraphQL as more than just \"self-documenting.\" The problem I will present is that I want more than a schema as a developer. I want to know how to use the schema to build my product. The solution to the problem will focus on interactive documentation by defining what makes it interactive, for example, embedded code samples linked to a user's sandbox environment. I will then explore how DevEx teams can implement these elements to create interactive documentation for their GraphQL API. I expect the audience to gain insight into exactly how they can create their own interactive GraphQL documentation and best practices. This presentation will help better the ecosystem by highlighting the pain points of GraphQL documentation as it exists today, emphasizing the need to create interactive documentation for developers working with GraphQL, and enforcing the importance of creating rich developer experiences.",

For example, how do we help new developers ship their first feature faster? GraphQL helps Platform API efforts ship features faster, but what about when your schema gets very complex? How can a new developer find what they need quickly? GraphQL already provides a complete and understandable description of the data in our APIs, but what if we provide that context to a LLM? In this talk, we'll journey through GitHub's APIs and explore how a GraphQL schema is a significant advantage in AI-based tooling. We're seeing more AI-based tools generate fetch code based on OpenAPI definitions, and while they may be tempting at first, it could be a decision with unexpected trade-offs. We'll show how to take a standard open-sourced LLM and provide a GraphQL-aware context to generate operations from text input. After this talk, you can safely bring AI to your developer efficiency initiatives with any LLM, 3rd party, or self-hosted!",

    "description": "Modern ERPs must be highly customizable and easily integrated with other systems while generating UI components on top should be seamless. In this talk, we will explore why GraphQL, with its robust and flexible querying capabilities, is exceptionally suited for developing modern ERP solutions. In addition, we’ll explore the technical aspects of generating front-end UI components directly from the GraphQL schema, what we call Schema-Driven UI, not Server-Driven UI. This approach is particularly beneficial in the ERP domain, where dynamic and complex data interactions are common. Automating the process of generating UI components directly from the Schema ensures consistency across systems by keeping everything in sync.",

    "description": "One of GraphQL’s killer features is field-granular error handling which can dramatically increase the resiliency of network responses. However, this has traditionally come at the cost of developer ergonomics, with client developers being forced to contend with nearly every field potentially being null. In the last year, members of the Nullability Working Group, and engineers at Meta have been exploring how we can untangle nullability and error handling in order to safely allow clients to “see” the true nullability of the server’s resolvers without sacrificing response residency. In this talk we’ll explain the ideas and RFCs that underpin this change, share the work we’ve done at Meta and across the community to validate this approach, and demonstrate Semantic Nullability in action!",

As subgraphs develop it has begun to be impossible for one to team to oversee all of the changes to the graph because of the rapid changes that occur from teams. As we have grown we created best practices and guidelines fro GraphQL. We soon recognised this was not enough and there was the need to track the quality of schemas over time automatically and in a way that can provide actionable feedback to teams. At Booking.com we have developed the infrastructure to analyse schemas beyond standard linting to help improve the quality of the Graph across the board enabling better developer experience for everyone.",

That poses challenges in environments with diverse microservices managed by various teams however, as found in most large organizations. Recognizing these challenges, we introduced Apollo Federation in 2019 to deliver on the promise of GraphQL within those environments. It respects existing service and team boundaries through a principled schema composition model that supports team collaboration and efficient, query plan-based execution across services. This has allowed GraphQL APIs to effectively scale to large numbers of services and teams. Given the success and common challenges observed, a working group comprising engineers from various organizations has been formed to establish a proposed open standard for federated GraphQL. This initiative aims to unify best practices and design principles. This talk will highlight the key discussions from this group and their implications for the evolving standard.",

    "description": "You've heard about distinguishing semantic vs error nulls, but what about \"unset\" fields? Unset fields are neither semantic or error nulls because the server has not calculated them. Why would something like this ever come up? - WhatsApp delta updates: When the client wants to tell the server, \"This is the value I have for this field, only bother calculating it again and sending it down if it's out of date.\" - Instagram server migration from a non-GraphQL server: We started with a server that has multiple code paths to resolve a field, and now we are not guaranteed every field we request will always be resolved. Not being able to distinguish between null and unset is a problem we expect is more widespread, and to which we have found a not amazing solution that could be better if we update the spec. How do you distinguish \"unset\" from null? - How you achieve this today (not particularly elegant, but possible) - Omission from server response? (not currently spec-compliant)",

    "description": "While working on the GraphQL composite schema specification, we have explored GraphQL batching and have come up with a variety of new approaches to tackle it. In this talk, I will walk you through why batching is still needed in GraphQL and what problems it solves today. We will also explore some wild experiments with GraphQL batching prototypes that can form business flows to aggregate data, mutate it, and subscribe to updates of the flow with subscriptions. This talk is full of experiments that are to be further explored. So, join me!",

Splitting network requests so that users can see high priority content faster, without fetching the same field twice. Loading the minimal JavaScript. Ensuring that their apps show the latest data, without excessively re-rendering. Ensuring content is garbage collected, but not disposing of resources still in use. Yeesh!\n\nAnd all the while, they're asked to maintain this performance profile while other developers make changes willy nilly.\n\nSounds impossible, and it is! With other frameworks, that is.\n\nFind out how Isograph makes all of this easy — and more!\n\nIsograph is a framework for building React apps powered by GraphQL data.

    "description": "Building a GraphQL API as a solo developer handling both the front end and back end in a single Git repository can be straightforward. However, in a real-world scenario, you will need to collaborate with other developers, both within your team and externally. There will be API consumers under your control, as well as those you might not even be aware of. If you use composite schemas (such as Federation), many teams will create their subgraphs to compose a supergraph. How can you safely evolve your schema without breaking clients? How do you prevent attackers from sending vulnerable GraphQL operations to your server? A schema registry can assist you and your team in successfully adopting GraphQL at scale. Discover how to gain analytics on your GraphQL API usage, avoid shipping breaking changes through CI/CD integrations, and prevent unwanted GraphQL operations by leveraging Persisted Documents using the open-source MIT-licensed Hive API platform specially designed for GraphQL.",

Traditional data architectures, designed with apps and APIs in mind, are now being pushed to their limits by the demands of advanced AI applications. This workshop will delve into principles for getting your data ready for AI. One of the main principles is having all your data and business logic under one interface - we will see how to build this using GraphQL (or SQL). We will also see how to incorporate consistent authorization so that your LLM doesn't have to worry about security. Finally, we will plumb all of this together to create a fundamentally powerful data connectivity for your AI applications.\n\nTo get the most out of this workshop, bring an Anthropic account with some credits and an Anthropic API key. You can also use OpenAI, but Anthropic is preferred.",
