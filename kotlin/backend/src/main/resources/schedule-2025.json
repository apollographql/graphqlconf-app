There are also updates on our existing initiatives including community grants and GraphQL Locals.\n\nThis talk is a thank you to the people behind the progress and a celebration of our growing constellation of contributors. It's also an invitation to step forward and get involved—one of the best ways to do that is by joining our new Community Working Group, giving passionate community members a voice in shaping the Foundation's directions and initiatives for the next ten years of GraphQL.",

As we continue modernizing our frontend architecture, one major challenge is identifying what data is already available, what’s duplicated, and what’s missing entirely from the graph. Using AI, we’ve begun introspecting legacy domains to map their data structures against the schema, surface PII fields for tagging and tracking, and inform where schema design can be improved. In this talk, we’ll share how we’re using AI to support schema modernization at scale, streamline developer experience, and bring more consistency to a graph that continues to grow and change across teams.",

    "description": "GraphQL error handling sucks. There, I said it.\n\nEver hunted through the errors list to figure out if a null was legit or caused by an error? If you're like me, you gave up and now treat nulls as \"maybe errored, maybe absent, maybe both.\"\n\nAnd nullability. Schema designers make anything that might fail nullable, producing partial responses when errors occur. But since anything can fail, now everything is nullable—\nand we're drowning in null checks. We recklessly cast to non-null or fall back to the empty string out of desperation. And we still don't know what's truly nullable.\n\nNo more.\n\nThis talk introduces a new, pragmatic approach, born from years of work by the Nullability WG. We propose a future where schemas reflect the true nullability of business entities, and error handling is where it belongs: in your code, not your data. Use your language's built-in tools to handle errors ergonomically; and drop the unnecessary null checks. When you read a null, it should mean one thing: the absence of data.\n\nThis isn't some distant ideal on the horizon of GraphQL's future; with just 512 bytes added to your GraphQL client, you can start adopting this today.

While a high level of Quality of Service is possible in other protocols such as STOMP or MQTT, there is no actual guarantee of delivery with GraphQL Subscriptions: any acknowledgment mechanism should be built in userland.\n \nWebSockets can be interrupted at any time with both graceful and ungraceful disconnections, and the lack of acknowledgment in the subscription protocol affects reliability, making GraphQL Subscription over WebSocket connections susceptible to disconnections, as any protocol failures will result in messages being lost. In other words, Subscriptions are stateful. In this talk, we will investigate a mitigation technique to make them resumable so that the connection can be destroyed and recreated without any message loss.",

    "description": "To ease life for the roughly 1,000 developers who contribute regularly to our GraphQL interface, Airbnb has a highly opinionated developer API that we believe eases life for both developers and the operators who maintain the service. In the past, this API was implemented on top of a traditional, specification-based GraphQL engine, which supported agility as we evolved our opinionated approach to resolvers. As that approach matured, we saw opportunities to build a more efficient engine to support them.\n \nThis talk describes our new GraphQL engine. Key elements in our design include:\n \n- Refactoring query execution into distinct resolution and completion phases.\n \n- A query planner that optimizes and orchestrates the execution of those phases.\n \n- A new data structure that is the intermediary between the two phases, a data structure that allows for principled communication between the many resolvers involved in executing a query",

We have a diverse set of clients such as Booking traveller, partner native apps/web clients, 140+ SSR (Server Side Rendering) services for Web/Mobile rendering, and AI chatbots. This level of adoption brings unique challenges in terms of security and traffic management. In Booking.com we have a large attack surface since our GraphQL schema is huge, to be specific we have ~7k types with 27k+ fields. In this session, we will share our schema driven approaches to mitigate risks due to authN/Z leaks, DDoS attacks or exposure of sensitive PII/PCI data. These methodologies are designed with a high degree of generality, ensuring their applicability and scalability across every other Federated GraphQL system.",

We will review the foundational elements of an Event Sourced application including some common architectural choices.\n \nGraphQL is known for expressive queries, precise data fetching, real-time capabilities, and a strong ecosystem. All of these pair well with Event Sourced applications. GraphQL simplifies the complexity of querying event streams, enables precise control over client-server interactions, and supports flexible schema evolution that is crucial to long term success. We will discuss this in the context of established patterns (and anti-patterns!).\n \nBy the end of this talk, attendees will clearly understand how combining Event Sourcing and GraphQL accelerates development and prepares data-driven apps to take advantage of AI-driven acceleration in the near future.",

From the intricacies of the profiles screen to the dynamic homepage and the seamless search for your favorite shows, our robust API layer is the backbone that supports it all.\n\nOperating at an astronomical scale, our two principal Subgraph Services collectively manage over a million GraphQL queries per second. This immense scale, coupled with the diverse queries our systems accommodate, ensures that even the most minute edge cases are brought to light.\n\nIn this presentation, we will delve into two significant production bugs that emerged at scale. The first involved a federation-based solution at the query planning layer, which culminated in a 20% reduction in requests per second and yielded substantial cost savings amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The second, a subgraph service specific enhancement, remarkably doubled the efficiency of our entire fleet.\n\nBy sharing our journey of identifying and resolving these issues, we aspire to provide insights that will directly enhance your day-to-day endeavors using GraphQL.",

    "description": "You added security measures to all your subgraphs and are sure you're safe? Think again. In a federated GraphQL system, the most significant risks often hide not within individual services, but within the logic and trust assumptions of the federation layer itself.\n \nThis talk explores how federated GraphQL architectures introduce a new class of security challenges that traditional testing and validation frequently overlook. We'll walk through practical examples based on real-world use cases and both offensive and defensive insights, showing why stitching secure services together doesn’t automatically result in a secure supergraph.\n \nAttendees will see federation-specific threats in action, learn important security concepts, and walk away with actionable strategies for hardening routers, auditing configurations, and building safer service interactions. We'll also share PoC code and conceptual outlines for detection tooling to help apply these learnings in real-world systems.\n \nAn engaging, practical, and scenario-driven session - especially relevant for developers and security engineers working with federated GraphQL systems.",

We’ll share how we approached this transition—starting from an existing internal schema that wasn’t shaped for external consumers—and the steps we took to expose only what was ready. Using Apollo Federation Contracts, we filtered out unstable or sensitive parts of the graph. Along the way, we defined best practices for the public schema, like cursor-based pagination, using oneOf for inputs and results.\nWe’ll also touch on how we serve the schema through Hive Gateway with a supergraph setup, and the security measures we added, like depth limiting and complexity analysis. To keep things evolving safely, we rely on GraphQL Hive to track usage and guide deprecations.\n \nIf you’re thinking about exposing a GraphQL API—or just want ideas for keeping one clean and manageable—this talk will share what worked for us, what didn’t, and what we learned.",

Yet, change is inevitable. Even if your schema seems flawless today (which it isn't), requirements will shift, new features will emerge, and regrets will follow.\n \nGraphQL promises evolvability, allowing us to move forward without multiple API versions. But how does this hold up in practice? We mark fields as @deprecated, but what happens next? How can we embrace experimentation without entombing technical debt in the API? Does federation complicate things? Evolving your schema without breaking clients is easy, right? Right??\n \nDrawing from experience with the Netflix API, this talk explores techniques for evolving your schema safely and painlessly. We'll cover the schema lifecycle—from experimentation to design, deprecation, and deletion.\n \nAttendees will leave with:\n- Schema design principles that facilitate change\n- Practical techniques for evolving GraphQL schemas\n- Strategies for managing a deprecation workflow\n \nJoin us as we learn to face the inevitability of change with confidence and serenity.",

    "description": "Over the past six years, Viaduct has grown from Airbnb’s unified data access layer into a central platform for hosting business logic — now supporting over 1 million lines of code, 500+ monthly contributors, and 100+ teams.\n\nThat scale has brought a familiar risk: the slow creep toward monolith. Viaduct was never meant to be a microservices system, but we’ve had to make deliberate choices to preserve team autonomy, performance, and codebase sanity.\n\nThis talk shares the strategies we’re using — and actively evolving — to make that possible, including:\n\n* Tenant modules that define slices of the GraphQL schema alongside their implementation logic;\n* Relying on GraphQL fragments instead of service calls for inter-module communication;\n* Building ownership and attribution into the platform so teams can trace metrics and errors back to themselves.\n\nWe haven’t fully solved these challenges — but we’ve learned a lot about what works, what breaks, and what to watch for.",

We'll start by creating a robust GraphQL API using Apollo Router, covering schema design and federation best practices.\n\nThen we'll extend your GraphQL API with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling structured AI data access and tool-based interactions. This allows AI assistants to query your products, manage inventory, and process orders directly through your API.This workshop emphasizes exceptional developer experience with hot-reloading capabilities across your entire stack for rapid iteration. You'll learn real-world patterns for connecting GraphQL APIs with MCP servers, handling data flow between layers, and maintaining type safety from your database to your AI tools.\n\nPrerequisites: Familiarity with GraphQL basics. Bring a laptop with Node.js installed.\n\nBy the end of this workshop, you'll be able to: Configure Apollo Router to orchestrate multiple GraphQL services into a unified graph Integrate microservices that extend and complement each other's capabilities Build and deploy a custom GraphQL API as part of your federated graph Expose any GraphQL operation as MCP tools with zero additional code, making your entire API instantly AI-accessible Understand practical use cases for AI-integrated applications in modern development workflows",

The goal is to showcase the powerful synergy between Relay’s declarative data fetching and RSC’s server-side rendering, creating an ideal stack for scalable, performant web applications. \n \nThe demo will highlight: \n \n- Co-location of GraphQL fragments with React components for a modular, maintainable codebase. \n- Relay’s type-safe queries to efficiently fetch data for posts, comments, and user profiles. \n- React Server Components to optimize server-side rendering and enable React streaming for progressive UI rendering. \n- A fully functional social media app with interactive, real-time features. \n \nThrough this hands-on demo, we’ll illustrate how Relay’s fragment-based architecture and RSC’s streaming capabilities allow developers to build responsive, data-driven applications. This workshop will demonstrate the potential of these technologies for modern frontend development providing a compelling case for adopting this stack in production projects.",

    "description": "Although the topic of namespacing has been brought up repeatedly in the GraphQL community over the last decade, there is an understandable worry that it would lead to anti-patterns in schema design. If namespacing is used as an excuse to avoid coordination between teams, this can result in a fragmented GraphQL schema that reflects current team boundaries as opposed to domain or client concerns.\n\nGraphQL Federation offers an alternative architecture: when coordination is enforced and consistency guaranteed, a large number of teams can contribute to a single, coherent GraphQL schema without the danger of stepping on each other's toes.\n\nEven with that architecture in place however, I believe there are still legitimate use cases for namespacing. In this talk, I will go over some of those use cases, and formulate a set of design principles that could guide the introduction of namespacing in GraphQL.",

In fact, it is too good to keep it to GraphQL subgraphs only — what if you could bring other kinds of APIs and data sources into your federated graph without having to write a dedicated GraphQL server in front of them?\n\nIn the course of the hands-on workshop, we will: Integrate a REST API, a Postgres database and a Kafka instance using open source extensions, Use the gRPC extension and the MCP server to understand, integrate and query gRPC services over GraphQL, Build a new custom extension together\nThe result will be a functioning GraphQL federated graph without GraphQL subgraphs, demonstrating that federation as a mechanism is useful beyond just GraphQL subgraphs.",

We will explore the choices that might be made if we could start over, free from the constraints of existing implementations.\n\nThe session focuses on key areas where the current GraphQL specification has faced challenges and sparked debate within the community. Discussions will cover: Union Types: Exploring alternative approaches to improve flexibility and usability. Schema-Defined Nullability: Rethinking how nullability is handled to enhance clarity and consistency. Error Handling: Proposing new strategies for more robust and intuitive error management.\n\nThrough collaborative discussions and interactive exercises, participants will contribute insights and ideas, shaping a theoretical vision of what GraphQL 2.0 could look like. This thought exercise is designed to challenge assumptions and inspire innovative solutions.\n\nThe session will conclude with a focus on the practicalities of evolving GraphQL towards a 2.0 version in the real world, exploring how to address these design challenges while considering migration paths and maintaining backward compatibility.",

Whether you're coming from Node.js, Java, .NET, or any other stack — this specification is designed to work with you, not against you.\n\nAt the heart of this new standard is a powerful idea: composing GraphQL APIs in a strongly typed way. No more hidden fields. No more untyped extensions or brittle conventions.\n\nYou'll learn how to:\nDesign and build a distributed GraphQL system using the Composite Schema Specification Compose services with clear ownership and type-safe contracts Evolve your composite schema over time without breaking a sweat Solve real-world challenges like shared types, or auth propagation Operate composed schemas with observability, continuous integration, and confidence\nWhether you're building from scratch or evolving an existing monolith, this workshop will equip you with the tools and mental models to harness composition — the right way.",

Most of its features are realized as plugins so much so that it actually has fewer capabilities than graphql-request at its core! Graffle initially grew out of my desire to have a JS GraphQL client with a fully featured and type safe document builder which I couldn’t get from tools like GenQL or Zeus at the time.\n\nGraffle is still a mostly unknown work in progress but I am ready to begin talking about it and already some early adopters have taken to giving regular feedback. I think GraphQL can benefit from strengthened integrations with TypeScript. My past work on Nexus underscores that belief and I've been happy to see more recent tools enter the space like Pothos.",

In this talk, we'll share the crucial technical decisions and community building strategies that transformed a hobby project into an industry standard. We'll share how we fostered contributions from over 250 volunteers while maintaining high code quality and project momentum. You'll walk away with actionable insights to help you lead any software project, whether it's open source or enterprise.\n\nAbout the speakers: we are the maintainers of GraphQL Java, who have guided the project from its first commit to becoming the industry standard.",

In this lightning talk, we'll explore an innovative idea of embedding accessibility metadata directly into GraphQL schemas. Inspired by using Kotlin semantics in Jetpack Compose, imagine annotating fields with labels, roles, or screen reader hints that can be used to support screen readers, improve navigation, and even power automated accessibility testing. By adding custom accessibility annotations, tools could generate more accessible UI components, which enhances both the developer experience and the user experience. This is a call to rethink the developer experience and treat accessibility as a first-class concern. Let's reimagine GraphQL not just as a data layer, but as an inclusive design enabler.",

    "description": "In theory, data loaders solve most \"N+1\" problems in GraphQL. In practice, they can be hard to implement, so they’re typically used only in performance-critical situations and often reactively, once inefficiencies surface. To achieve better performance, batching needs to be applied wherever possible.\n \nThis talk introduces batch resolvers, a more developer-friendly alternative to data loaders. While traditional GraphQL resolvers take a single input and produce a single output, batching resolvers take a list of inputs and return a list of outputs. A batch resolver can simply call a batch service API without worrying about data loaders.\n \nWhen a developer provides a batch resolver, our GraphQL server automatically aggregates individual data fetches into a single call to that resolver. It can also apply heuristics to improve aggregation, for example by consolidating different selection sets for the same entity into a single input. This design not only makes application developers’ lives easier, but also allows the server to better optimize query execution by coordinating batch dispatching as part of a broader execution strategy.",

    "description": "Traditional GraphQL servers execute queries field by field with a depth-first algorithm as defined in the GraphQL specification. In contrast, GraphQL federation gateways need to partition the query and retrieve chunks of data from external data sources, creating new challenges. We'll present how we solved those challenges with a focus on performance.\n \nThe first, query planning, is to find the best possible plan with the multiple possibilities federation offers to unify your data and the various data sources with their requirements. We express this problem as a graph of possibilities and solve it as a Steiner Tree problem. The second challenge is performant execution. As we need to read and write overlapping chunks of the response in parallel, it's hard to be as efficient as a traditional GraphQL server writing a response iteratively with independent fields. We build an execution DAG with field dependencies, parallelizing work as much as possible without any lock on the response. We also pre-compute the expected data shape to ingest and validate incoming data into the response without any intermediate memory allocation.",

This year, we’ll discuss how to safely roll it out.\n \nYou’ve had a GraphQL codebase that weakly handled server-side errors for years. Now, you have the tools (directives, hooks, handlers, and language features) that let you treat field errors properly. However, it’s a daunting task to suddenly explode queries en-masse by flipping a switch. This move is powerful, but requires a thoughtful and data-driven approach to do safely.\n \nIn this talk we’ll cover:\n* Preparing the groundwork for migration to stricter error handling\n* Using data to make informed decisions about fragment/query behavior\n* Gating your change at a singular point\n* Scaling the rollout to a large codebase\n* How we’re approaching this rollout at Meta",

    "description": "One of the great achievements of GraphQL is composable, full-stack type safety: a strongly-typed schema, against which one writes client components, and from which minimal yet sufficient queries are generated. This seamless flow from database to UI, with immediate feedback, compile-time guarantees and great performance, represents an unmatched DevEx breakthrough.\n \nBut what if we use a full-stack client (like Isograph aims to be)? Or use a rich client in combination with a Hasura, Prisma or PostGraphile, and effectively write components against an SQL schema? Have both the GraphQL schema and its operation language become mere implementation details?\n \nIn this talk, I'll explore how GraphQL's apparent disappearance into tooling actually represents its ultimate victory. Even as GraphQL-the-syntax fades from view, its architectural innovations—fragment composability, full-stack type safety, document merging, persisted operations—become the invisible foundation of modern development.\n \nThe best way to honor this legacy isn't to protect its syntax — it's to let its principles be reborn in new forms, evolving as our tools evolve, making app development better for years to come.",

    "description": "When adopting GraphQL, teams diligently follow \"best practices\" without realizing they're actually choosing between two fundamentally different approaches: designing schemas to serve UI components (frontend-first) or to represent domain models (structure-first). This distinction is rarely framed as an explicit choice in GraphQL literature, with most examples showcasing the structure-first approach by default.\n\nYet this initial decision shapes everything from your team structure to how you handle breaking changes—and if you start with a structure-first approach, it's especially difficult to unwind that decision later. In this session, we'll explore the critical differences between these philosophies, examine how they manifest in real schemas, and analyze the trade-offs each approach presents. You'll see how changes that feel natural in one approach become deeply problematic in the other, and learn to identify which patterns your team has already begun to follow.",

We will dive into the choices made, the GraphQL features that we leveraged (one among all, Trusted Documents to exploit CDNs and improve security), the issues that we've encountered while building the system, and the benefits that we gained from all perspectives: user experience, development perspective, feature delivery and time to market.",

    "description": "\"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things\".\n\nGraphQL provides many benefits over other query languages. Federation builds on top of this foundation to provide even more flexibility and power. But even with all that GraphQL has to offer, the problem of naming remains.\n\nIn this talk, Jeff Dolle, from The Guild, will share what he's learned about schema design: proven design philosophies, designing for forward compatibility, exposing errors through types, and tips for how to avoid ambiguous or misleading type names.\n\nTogether, we will then go through an example product design meeting: taking user stories and building a complete GraphQL schema.",

    "description": "Plugging an LLM into GraphQL sounds simple—until it drowns in thousands of fields, types, and connections. Most models today can’t reason effectively over large APIs without brittle prompt hacks or hardcoded shortcuts.\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) is the cutting-edge solution for enabling seamless, dynamic interactions between LLMs and external tooling. It standardizes the way models interact with various tools, breaking down barriers between APIs and AI systems.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll discover how to turn any GraphQL endpoint into an MCP-compatible server with minimal overhead. Reuse your existing GraphQL infrastructure to avoid reinventing authorization, schema management, and validation enabling scalable, robust LLM integrations. We’ll compare existing tools and automated schema discovery against hand-crafted mappers based on benchmarks of public GraphQL APIs. Join us to learn about our experiences and recommendations for your next GenAI project, powered by GraphQL.",

    "description": "Pinterest is adopting GraphQL. Given our app's size, we can't simply rewrite everything in one fell swoop. So, we created the Relay Migration API (RMA) — a set of tools to incrementally migrate your React components to consume GraphQL-shaped data while making requests to REST endpoints.\n\nI'll share how we've significantly evolved the RMA after migrating four key surfaces, focusing on the advanced challenges we faced:\n\nRMA recreates objects on every render by default, breaking components expecting stable references. We implemented a caching layer, similar to Relay's, to return consistent objects between renders. RMA originally read from static source objects, creating stale data when Redux state changed. Our solution: a selective subscription system that re-computes GraphQL data only when source fields change, keeping data current while eliminating unnecessary renders. And in cases where Redux and GraphQL schemas fundamentally differ, we built bidirectional mapping with schema validation to ensure data consistency.\nJoin us to learn how the Relay migration API has evolved and how it helps you accelerate your GraphQL migrations without disrupting existing applications!",
