And even run it all on the client side\nIn this workshop, we will go through the many novel ideas behind GraphQL Mesh, see them in action and learn how to use this complete API platform today on your existing codebase.\n\nWe will leave time for an open Q&A session where we can talk in-depth about your current setups and how you could leverage The Guild's ecosystem of tools.",

      "description": "Many GraphQL adopters today use both API gateways and separate GraphQL servers to secure and route traffic to their service endpoints. GraphQL provides a consistent API for clients, but it's expensive to build and operate distinct GraphQL servers. Developers are often required to write custom code to provide platform features like security, caching, and resilience. What if there were another way? What if you could meld GraphQL server capabilities into an Envoy gateway without separate server deployments? And without disturbing upstream application services? In this fast-paced, hands-on workshop, every attendee can use their own sandboxed environment to explore these topics together: • Discovery: Inspect existing service contracts and derive GraphQL schema. • Declarative: Create IaC resolvers that consume OpenAPI services. • Stitching: Execute GraphQL queries across multiple services with a unified supergraph. • Gateway Integration: Use declarative policies to mix in gateway features like authNZ and data loss prevention. Buckle your seat belts! This Wild Ride will help you accelerate GraphQL adoption using infrastructure-as-code principles in a cloud-native environment.",

We will cover server-side fetching with React Server components, how to use Redwood cells, and migrating to fragments. Additionally, we’ll review GraphQL fundamentals inside Redwood, including security concerns and best practices, directives, and authentication.

      "description": "As the adoption of GraphQL has grown, so too have the prevailing patterns for how GraphQL APIs are developed and deployed. Gone are the days where every GraphQL API was a development task to code, deploy, and manage GraphQL middleware connected to your data sources. Increasingly, GraphQL is supported as a native API for data sources, integrated directly in gateway routers and application sidecars, and provided directly in edge compute platforms and CDN providers. While this level of optimization is common as application protocols and languages reach widespread adoption, it’s critically important to understand the best practices and patterns for how GraphQL should be used at each layer of your application networking architecture. This talk will provide a survey of existing and emerging trends for application networking architectures with GraphQL, providing concrete examples and advice on how to build scalable and performant architectures for your GraphQL APIs.",

GraphQL, as a groundbreaking data query language and API, is ideally positioned to support such principles.\n\nIn this talk, we will provide an overview of FAIR and open the discussion around potential integration and synergies with GraphQL to help turn the FAIR vision into reality. Such integration would also expose GraphQL to new audiences and drive its adoption.\n\nAs a bonus topic, we will also explore the potential relationship and synergies between GraphQL and SPARQL, the RDF Query Language, such as exposing SPARQL endpoints as GraphQL APIs and integrating semantic RDF data into the GraphQL data graph.",

This groundbreaking research, involving a scan of over 1500 GraphQL endpoints, revealed a staggering 46,000+ security issues and sensitive data leaks, all accessible without authentication and with 10% classified as critical. In this session, Tristan and Antoine will share their unique testing methodology and delve into the most common GraphQL vulnerabilities unearthed during their research. They'll expose GraphQL-specific vulnerabilities, including complexity issues and schema leaks, alongside persistent standard API security threats like injections and server errors. They'll also highlight the often-underestimated problem of data leaks, including sensitive personal information and tokens. But, they won't leave you in the trenches; they'll showcase practical remediation strategies, introducing tools like GraphQL Armor and a handy security checklist for developers.

Choose compelling design goals for a serialization format Build up a format with distinct advantages over JSON Compare and analyze the practical tradeoffs between JSON and a purpose-built format By the end of the session, we will have built up to Argo: a compact and compressible binary serialization format for GraphQL. After the session, more details can be found in Argo’s open source specification, design notes, and reference implementation.\nThis talk assumes significant familiarity with GraphQL (particularly the Schema Definition Language) and JSON.\nSee Argo on GitHub, Argo homepage (including link to Argo spec), or Mike's website.",

Attendees will learn about the key components required to develop a well-defined and well-governed API program, including API specifications, governance and consistency, dev community & help, and closed-loop feedback. While there are a lot of guidelines and best practices for REST APIs in the industry, there are not yet as many guidelines for GraphQL. Intuit made over 56 million transactions with GraphQL over the 2023 tax peak season, and that number will only get larger from here. GraphQL adoption at this scale required us to build a robust API program with a centralized set of guidelines on how the schema should be composed, along with a community-driven review process and a firm but flexible governance framework. In this session, we will share insights and lessons learned using real-life examples from our GraphQL API Program, enabling attendees to apply these learnings to their own businesses. This session offers a valuable opportunity for businesses to develop their API programs and stay competitive.",

      "description": "The Common Metadata Repository (CMR), NASA's datastore for Earth science metadata offers multiple API's that allow users to access the underlying data in many ways. With the launch of recent missions, CMR's usage has increased exponentially; this usage and the features added to support new capabilities have made it increasingly difficult to keep it's response formats and capabilities consistent and performant. Unfortunately agency requirements and existing CMR client implementations limit our ability to change our APIs. In our research for a solution that would allow us to work within these limitations, the use of GraphQL as an abstraction layer would mean that our existing APIs could remain unchanged. Additionally, this would allow us to offer new functionality via a self-documenting, specification based approach. Our introduction of GraphQL has allowed us to normalize the ways that users communicate with our APIs and enabled us to make changes to our core APIs with no impact to clients. In this talk, I'll discuss the challenges, wins, losses, and lessons learned in wrapping CMR's API with GraphQL and how it's being utilized today.",

It has been an incredible learning experience, and it has been very rewarding to meet the engineers using the library all over the world. But it wasn’t always an open source fairytale!

Within the world of web3 there are many different ways to use smart contracts, so Subgraphs are modular APIs enabling developers to build for any use case. These subgraphs can be queried via The Graph, a decentralized network for accessing blockchain data.\n\nIn this presentation we will explore: Practical aspects of accessing blockchain data using Subgraphs, including the basics of building a GraphQL schema Discuss efficient Data optimization Utility of GraphQL for blockchain data Elements of decentralization and data\nLearn how Subgraphs simplify the data extraction from blockchains, optimize data handling, and enhance query flexibility. Join us to understand how these elements work together to make blockchain data more accessible and manageable.",

      "description": "Over the past decade of GraphQL, many implementations have emerged from the community, primarily that of imperative approaches to GraphQL. However, recently we have seen an uptick in implementations that allow for declarative configuration of GraphQL schemas and resolvers. These declarative approaches offer new possibilities in terms of managing and scaling GraphQL APIs. In this talk, we will dive into the challenges of implementing a declarative API for GraphQL and explore the solutions that exist in the ecosystem. Firstly, we will introduce several prominent solutions that enable declarative configuration of GraphQL APIs, such as Gloo GraphQL, GraphQL Mesh, and StepZen. We will compare and contrast these solutions, highlighting their unique features, capabilities, and integration possibilities with existing infrastructure. We will then delve into the more technical aspects and challenges of implementing a highly performant GraphQL server that we built-in as a component of the industry standard Envoy proxy. By the end of this talk, attendees will be left with a comprehensive understanding of declarative GraphQL and the solutions available in the ecosystem.",

Here, we will discuss the challenges and issues that led us here, our motivation for replacing Apollo Uplink as the single source of truth for our supergraph schemas, the alternative solutions we considered, and, finally, why we decided to take the path that we did--essentially reinventing the wheel--and where we plan to take it going forward. Attendees will leave with a deep understanding of the tradeoffs with respect to managed federation in mission critical environments, specifically as they relate to use of Apollo's Uplink service as a single source of truth. Moreover, attendees will walk away with a general plan for how to mitigate the challenges and limitations above, using Mission Control as the seminal example.",

Where does GraphQL fit in and how might it evolve over the months to come?\n\nIn this talk, I'll focus on specific technical and developer-experience benefits of a GraphQL and \"server side React\" overlap, along with some code examples. Next, I'll talk about areas where the value provided by GraphQL is orthogonal to the benefits of React Server Components and Server Actions. Finally, through this exploration and these examples, I'll end on an opinionated note that GraphQL's future is with Relay and its usage as a BFD 🤯 (?!), instead of a BFF.",

GraphQL, an open standard and protocol for APIs, is both good and great. It allows your designer to explore the full capabilities of your data so they can conceive of the best user experience possible. GraphQL allows your engineers to say “three weeks” to your product manager where they would have said “two months” before. These enhancements have a practical impact on the relationships that are the foundation of your cross-functional team’s success. In this talk I’ll address some of the challenges product teams face as their understanding of the end user starts to outpace their ability to ship new features (which is healthy). Then, I will give some concrete examples where GraphQL can make a difference. A/B tests and designer productivity will be covered, all drawn from my experiences in both IC and EM roles on product engineering teams. For each of these scenarios I’ll show how GraphQL principles and tooling can give your team a practical advantage.",

      "description": "Typically, GraphQL schemas are constructed statically, and services will expose one or a set number of schemas depending on the roles of clients that query the system. When the system is highly configurable, allowing the creation of new types and fields at runtime, with different types and fields exposed depending on the clients privileges, building a set of static schemas becomes infeasible. This talk will discuss a technique used to construct types and fields at runtime, reflecting the users level of access within the system. This technique allowed us to scale to millions of schemas which reflected the permissions of the client querying the GraphQL endpoint. I will discuss the interplay between the static parts of the schema available to all clients and the dynamic parts built depending on the users privileges, as well as how to represent this structure with a \"metaschema\". Then, I'll demonstrate a pattern for constructing types at runtime, with a service responsible for safe instantiation that honors the GraphQL spec, interacting with a set of actors that control which types should be instantiated. I'll close with some discussion of how the spec impacts dynamic construction.",

      "description": "Make no mistake about it: threat actors are increasingly bent on hunting down, attacking, and exploiting your GraphQL APIs. But understanding exactly how these actors go about recognizing where your GraphQL APIs reside—and how their attacks proceed—can put you on the right road to attack-thwarting countermeasures. GraphQL’s declarative query language enables clients to collect information using specialized queries. Threat actors commonly interrogate APIs in order to uncover critical information that could aid in further attacks. These information-gathering and reconnaissance tactics feed into the logic of their scanning tools to determine the location of GraphQL APIs—and what they contain. Session attendees will come away with thorough knowledge of how to detect and mitigate nefarious GraphQL activities, and how to implement a security layer to protect targeted GraphQL APIs and effectively block attacks. Attendees of this GraphQLConf talk will learn: -- The techniques attackers use to gather information on your GraphQL APIs -- The telltale anomalous behavior associated with that reconnaissance, and -- How to surface threats and block those attack paths before exploits occur.",

While it may seem convenient and simplifies code readability, this seemingly innocuous choice can have unforeseen consequences for your applications, especially during service disruptions. Moreover, these downsides might not become apparent until a significant portion of your schema has been marked as non-nullable. In this talk, we will: - Challenge the traditional server-centric approach and advocate for shifting the responsibility of field nullability to the client. - Explore the reasons behind this paradigm shift and introduce existing and upcoming tools that empower clients to determine whether a field can be null or not. - Delve into the Client Controlled Nullability proposal, demonstrating its potential in GraphQL workflows. - Provide practical methods and best practices to safely migrate away from a non-null schema, ensuring compatibility with existing clients without causing disruptions.",

      "description": "There is a bright future for AI-driven integration, both in the application of integration to provide access to enterprise data for use by AI tools and also for application of AI to benefit the delivery of integration scenarios. However, AI foundation models must be complemented by integration and API technologies, and GraphQL can be the perfect technology for this. Having founded StepZen (now acquired by IBM) I have a particular bias for GraphQL applications, but in this case they can be especially powerful. AI applications can be trained to call one universal GraphQL API, and not have to deal with the subtleties of formats and authorizations and sideways information passing if the application were to learn multiple backends. In this talk I’ll explain why AI needs GraphQL for integrations, and what the future of AI and GraphQL looks like.",

We soon realised as a team this would not scale for an entire company.\n\nThis talk focuses on our experience and our journey from our first steps into the world of GraphQL and then our leap to move to a Federated GraphQL layer.\n\nWe will share some of our most important learnings from the challenges we faced, including scaling and resiliency, bringing on legacy services, and multi cloud support and how we are handling these challenges via our ongoing initiatives and what we think the future of GraphQL at Booking.com looks like.",

      "description": "This talk will explore the advantages of using a code-first approach for developing GraphQL APIs over a schema-first approach. GraphQL has gained popularity as a modern API technology that enables developers to build APIs that are flexible, performant, and easy to use. However, one of the challenges of using GraphQL is deciding whether to use a schema-first or a code-first approach.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss how code-first allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability in GraphQL API development. We'll explore how it can improve the development process, especially for large teams and complex projects. By using code-first, developers can write code that generates the schema, which provides greater control over the API design and allows for more efficient iteration.Moreover, we'll examine how Strawberry, a GraphQL library built on Python, leverages the power of Python's type system to provide an end-to-end type-safe code-first approach. This approach allows developers to define their GraphQL schema using Python classes, which Strawberry then converts into a GraphQL schema, ensuring type safety throughout the development process.",

      "description": "GraphQL is agnostic to the transport layer. Almost all out of the box observability tooling is tailored to REST/HTTP APIs. Major observability challenge with GraphQL over HTTP is the support of partial response and HTTP status with 2XX may have failed. GraphQL Gateway generally fans-out one incoming request to one or many outgoing subgraph requests. It is essential to monitor each subgraph and the GraphQL gateway’s metrics and also to trace a single request across the network stack. This talk will cover how Intuit is reducing Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) for GraphQL APIs, by capturing Failed Customer Interactions, Golden Signal to determine gateway and subgraph’s health, latency, error rate and other related metrics. This talk will also cover open tracing and logging for GraphQL APIs.",

      "description": "At last year’s GraphQL Conf, Stephanie Saunders sang the praises of schema mocking in her excellent talk “Sophisticated Schema Mocking”. As Stephanie outlined, tests written using mock schemas have several benefits over ones written with static response mocks (seriously, go back and watch the talk if you haven’t!) Mock schemas are the perfect pair for Mock Service Worker which describes itself as “an API mocking library that allows you to write client-agnostic mocks and reuse them across any frameworks, tools, and environments.” In this talk, I’ll demonstrate how to use mock schemas with MSW using testing tools created by the Apollo Client team. These utilities can be used with any GraphQL client for the web whether it’s Apollo Client, Relay, urql, isograph or even just plain fetch requests to a GraphQL endpoint, and support incremental delivery (@defer/@stream), subscriptions and more. With MSW + your front-end stack of choice + test runner or framework of choice (Jest, Puppeteer, Cypress, Storybook, the list goes on) this talk will teach you how to level up the tests you and your team are writing.",

      "description": "WebAssembly is reshaping our approach to software execution units and components. With its ecosystem maturing--the ability to deploy with multiple cloud providers, the standardization of WebAssembly Components, and the rise of WASI--its potential is fast becoming a reality. WebAssembly is especially suitable for running server-side code at the edge, where resource constraints and security concerns are paramount. To realize the full potential of running API servers at the edge--lowered latency, reduced costs, and improved scalability--we must rethink our approach to building and deploying servers. GraphQL is particularly well-suited for edge deployments. It not only reduces the number of trips between the client and the server but also allows implementations to optimize the whole query to reduce round trips to the data server. In this session, we will explore how to target a Rust implementation of GraphQL server to WebAssembly. We'll also look into how this fits within the WebAssembly ecosystem and how you can run these servers even in your browser.",

      "description": "Pinterest is too large to simply “rewrite our app” to use GraphQL in one fell swoop. Even migrating an individual screen takes months, at our scale this is quite challenging, like changing a plane’s engine while flying. Is GraphQL adoption destined to be difficult for large companies? Can this process be made more incremental? Unfortunately, the answer seems to be no. It's hard to imagine how components consuming GraphQL data can coexist on a page that makes network requests to a REST endpoint. And yet, we figured it out. And we had a good time, too! We designed Relay-compatible APIs that allow us to read data either from a GraphQL store or from arbitrary objects (e.g. from Redux.) So, engineers can migrate individual components within a larger tree. These components specify the data they need using a fragment, and receive GraphQL-shaped data, regardless of whether the data came from GraphQL or REST. When a component tree is fully migrated, we're able to A/B test the REST and GraphQL endpoints, and only turn on GraphQL when we're sure doing so won't degrade any metrics. And we're about to release this to open source: adopting GraphQL on the front-end has never been easier!",

Using only queries and polling we quickly ran into scalability issues and had to rethink our approach. Therefore we went to the drawing board and designed and built a serverless architecture on top of AWS and GraphQL over WebSocket to support our stream-aligned teams in building serverless subscriptions in a microservice environment.

In the Node.js implementation of graphql, promises wrapping primitive values are especially disruptive, since they add a large computing overhead. The context size creates a memory usage baseline that can rise very quickly with even small additions to the context, when there are many concurrent contexts. The execution can create temporary objects, increasing memory usage. Often-run resolvers, such as those responsible for filling out large arrays of objects, can become performance bottlenecks. At Auction.com, our search results page (SRP) requests up to 500 items of roughly 80 fields each. The query resolving these fields was suffering a high latency. We shall examine the tools to instrument our code and identify memory usage and CPU utilization bottlenecks. Our realtime elements (e.g. realtime updates to the status of currently viewed properties) are implemented using a translation of kafka messages to graphql updates. We shall present the tools and procedures to reduce memory usage and CPU usage when fanning out such messages.",

      "description": "Many of the most common issues developers run into when building GraphQL APIs (N+1 queries, difficult authorization logic, protecting against arbitrary query complexity) come down to a single problem: when an untrusted client can construct arbitrary queries, lots can go wrong. So what if they just couldn't? The wins of GraphQL aren't in letting *clients* build their own queries but in letting *client developers* build their own queries. When Firebase chose GraphQL as the basis for its new Data Connect product, we introduced \"Connectors\", a new resource type that bundles a group of predefined GraphQL queries and mutations and exposes them at an endpoint. While trusted servers can execute arbitrary queries, untrusted clients can only use predefined queries and mutations. This approach substantially simplifies the security model of building with GraphQL. Rather than worrying about every possible query, you can build authorization and complexity mechanics around well-known predefined queries. Learn the how, the why, and the possible future of \"Connectors\" for GraphQL in Firebase and beyond.",

      "description": "In this talk, I will go through two recent experiments at Meta where we improved Application scroll perf (commonly known as frame drops) and media stalls by developing advanced GraphQL features. 1. Batched @defers. Common UI update cycles with regular defers will introduce increased state updates and may cause unnecessary re-renders. By batching deferred payloads carefully, we can achieved improved latency without introduce frame drops which is commonly associated with decreased engagement. 2. Improved CDN prefetch. Most of the time, the bottleneck to TTI is the media loads, either image load or video load. Commonly, Applications prefetch these media from CDN to improve stalls. We can make the prefetch better by using the visitor pattern which is available in many GraphQL library to enable prefetch during parsing time.",

This means we let our implementations drive our GraphQL schema. However, our developers have a growing appetite to agree on our schema up front before diving into implementation. This talk will explore how we shifted our architecture to use a schema-first approach within a code-first framework. \n \nOverall, I aim to dispel the notion that using a code-first solution prevents us from defining schema as a first step. I will explore the advantages of doing schema review at scale, as well as highlight an open source GraphQL-Codegen plugin we built to generate Kotlin classes and interfaces from our schema definitions. \n \nI am eager to contribute to the conversation around schema-first vs code-first, which has been the topic of several GraphQLConf talks over the past few years. This approach brings a fresh perspective and should inspire folks to incorporate a schema-first mentality into their GraphQL development cycle.",

      "description": "In this talk, we'll explore the future of GraphQL and why its success hinges on our collective ability to address the elephant in the room of governance.\n\nDespite its popularity among developers due to its flexibility and efficiency, GraphQL has yet to fully win over enterprise architects. Their world revolves around REST, model-first abstractions, data lineage, and rigorous compliance standards. To truly gain their trust and drive broader adoption in the enterprise, I'll argue that GraphQL implementations must be metadata-driven, with an emphasis on configuration over code.\n\nHowever, all is not lost! In today’s enterprise landscape, the domain model is predicated on the principle that the teams who own the data should also be responsible for managing it and making it available through agnostic channels. With this in mind, GraphQL is uniquely positioned to excel, thanks to its capabilities in federation and schema stitching. These features enable a paradigm that scales both technically and, more importantly, organizationally, aligning with the goals of managing traceability, lineage, and compliance in a manner that satisfies regulatory demands.\n\nIn this session, we'll delve into how the future of GraphQL, much like the stability of any nation, is rooted in good governance. We'll examine the priorities of enterprise architects and demonstrate how a governance-focused approach can help GraphQL evolve into a robust data access layer within any business.",

The flexibility and expressiveness provided by a GraphQL schema seems to be a perfect fit for use with type-safe coding languages. But there are many challenges to overcome when consuming a GraphQL schema in strictly type-safe languages. This talk will discuss why GraphQL seems to conflict with type safety; explore some of the notable challenges GraphQL client developers face when consuming a GraphQL API; and uncover how the Apollo team has approached solutions for many of these issues in Swift and the Apollo iOS client.",

In September 2016, when our team of ten-odd full-stack engineers adopted GraphQL, we were handling a few thousand requests per second on our GraphQL layer. Fast forward to 2023, the engineering team has grown to 1,000 members managing half a billion requests per minute at peak. In this talk we aim to address critical questions regarding GraphQL's performance, when is the right time to integrate it, exploring whether GraphQL is predominantly a front-end abstraction or if it can also be effectively utilized in back-end operations for service-to-service communication. Drawing from years of extensive GraphQL usage at a significant scale—without the need for federation—we will introduce for the first time an open-source project that helped us elegantly design, streamline, and scale optimal GraphQL APIs.",

      "description": "In this session - we’ll explore how GraphQL Clients can provide a road for developers to make full use of Semantic Nullability! GraphQL Spec defines that field errors should result in a null value. This makes null values ambiguous - either null due to error - or null due to nullability. Semantic Nullability allows you to define nullability explicitly - see https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/discussions/1410 Therefore, GraphQL Clients need to be able to handle errors differently - giving engineers more confidence in how field states are handled. In this session, we'll cover: 1. Why explicitly handling errors can enable us to move to a new normal where all errors are surfaced explicitly (throw-by-default on error) 2. How using @catch directive allows us to differentiate error nulls from true nulls in product code 3. Steps 1 and 2 will require developers to handle errors explicitly - and this opens the door to Semantic Nullability! I’ll also cover how working on the @catch directive helped push the semantic nullability conversation forward, the rollout at Meta, and what future capabilities can be unlocked.

The talk will cover architecture, technologies, process and an overview of our application. We have moved significant portions of our application from a legacy database management and application framework to a modern relational database with a microservice business logic layer and a single page application client. GraphQL is used to tie the application, data and business logic together in a single API that is shared across multiple applications and modules. The initial approach has evolved into a platform for building applications that host complex data and business logic. We are also evolving our architecture to deliver data from our applications directly to legislative branch partners over a GraphQL endpoint, replacing multiple legacy delivery methods.",

In this talk, I will look at various implementations of implementation-first and explain why Facebook chose this approach to build their own GraphQL server and why it is actually the better approach in most projects.",

      "description": "Discovering GraphQL fields and generating queries is a tedious task for developers. They spend a considerable amount of time finding the appropriate fields in large schemas. To solve this problem at Intuit where we have a super graph consisting of millions of lines we implemented a framework that makes use of Generative AI to help developers with attribute discovery and query generation. The benefits of our approach include being able to work with large schemas without the hassle of going through the whole schema and requiring less back and forth communication between consumers and schema owners, which results in a huge boost in developer productivity. We created chunks of the schema and ingested them into a vector store, we then do a retrieval, dynamically build a minimal schema and perform RAG where the LLM is provided with the minimal schema and the user query. The LLM responds with either a list of discovered attributes or GraphQL query. This framework aims to achieve lower latency and less hallucinations by reducing the size of the schema sent to the LLM, this also results in lower costs and higher accuracy.",

The way developers query and interact with the database has been greatly simplified by this integration. We will introduce the concept of Duality Views, a brand-new feature available in Oracle Database 23ai. Using Duality Views, data is still stored in relational tables in a highly efficient normalized format but is accessed by apps in the form of JSON documents. Duality Views are created using an intuitive and flexible GraphQL-like syntax, enhancing developer productivity. \n \nWe will also demonstrate new capabilities in the database to automatically infer the GraphQL schema from existing relational schemas, making it easy to introspect and visualize the relational schema as well as write GraphQL queries against the database. Finally, we will talk about new GraphQL directives to allow calculations, reshaping, and transformations in a GraphQL query that can be executed on a relational database. \n \nCome learn how Oracle's support for GraphQL is transforming data access and providing a powerful and seamless solution for modern application development.",

I want to know how to use the schema to build my product. The solution to the problem will focus on interactive documentation by defining what makes it interactive, for example, embedded code samples linked to a user's sandbox environment. I will then explore how DevEx teams can implement these elements to create interactive documentation for their GraphQL API. I expect the audience to gain insight into exactly how they can create their own interactive GraphQL documentation and best practices. This presentation will help better the ecosystem by highlighting the pain points of GraphQL documentation as it exists today, emphasizing the need to create interactive documentation for developers working with GraphQL, and enforcing the importance of creating rich developer experiences.",

      "description": "GraphQL poses unique challenges when it comes to security due to the nature of its powerful query language. In this talk we'll explore different types of GraphQL APIs and their varying and common security needs. We'll then look at the techniques that can be used to protect these APIs and which techniques pair well with each API type. These techniques are not specific to any one vendor or programming language but general best practices that help protect your servers from threats both known and unknown. Attendees will come away with an understanding of common threats GraphQL APIs face, and suitable techniques to address them.",

      "description": "Platform engineering and internal developer portals have been a growing trend in the tech industry to make developers more efficient. For example, how do we help new developers ship their first feature faster? GraphQL helps Platform API efforts ship features faster, but what about when your schema gets very complex? How can a new developer find what they need quickly? GraphQL already provides a complete and understandable description of the data in our APIs, but what if we provide that context to a LLM? In this talk, we'll journey through GitHub's APIs and explore how a GraphQL schema is a significant advantage in AI-based tooling. We're seeing more AI-based tools generate fetch code based on OpenAPI definitions, and while they may be tempting at first, it could be a decision with unexpected trade-offs. We'll show how to take a standard open-sourced LLM and provide a GraphQL-aware context to generate operations from text input. After this talk, you can safely bring AI to your developer efficiency initiatives with any LLM, 3rd party, or self-hosted!",

However, this has traditionally come at the cost of developer ergonomics, with client developers being forced to contend with nearly every field potentially being null. In the last year, members of the Nullability Working Group, and engineers at Meta have been exploring how we can untangle nullability and error handling in order to safely allow clients to “see” the true nullability of the server’s resolvers without sacrificing response residency. In this talk we’ll explain the ideas and RFCs that underpin this change, share the work we’ve done at Meta and across the community to validate this approach, and demonstrate Semantic Nullability in action!",

As subgraphs develop it has begun to be impossible for one to team to oversee all of the changes to the graph because of the rapid changes that occur from teams. As we have grown we created best practices and guidelines fro GraphQL. We soon recognised this was not enough and there was the need to track the quality of schemas over time automatically and in a way that can provide actionable feedback to teams. At Booking.com we have developed the infrastructure to analyse schemas beyond standard linting to help improve the quality of the Graph across the board enabling better developer experience for everyone.",

      "description": "GraphQL was conceived as a unified access layer that empowers product teams by providing a common language for exposing and consuming data capabilities. These capabilities were typically implemented in a single schema through a resolver-based model. That poses challenges in environments with diverse microservices managed by various teams however, as found in most large organizations. Recognizing these challenges, we introduced Apollo Federation in 2019 to deliver on the promise of GraphQL within those environments. It respects existing service and team boundaries through a principled schema composition model that supports team collaboration and efficient, query plan-based execution across services. This has allowed GraphQL APIs to effectively scale to large numbers of services and teams. Given the success and common challenges observed, a working group comprising engineers from various organizations has been formed to establish a proposed open standard for federated GraphQL. This initiative aims to unify best practices and design principles. This talk will highlight the key discussions from this group and their implications for the evolving standard.",

Why would something like this ever come up? - WhatsApp delta updates: When the client wants to tell the server, \"This is the value I have for this field, only bother calculating it again and sending it down if it's out of date.\" - Instagram server migration from a non-GraphQL server: We started with a server that has multiple code paths to resolve a field, and now we are not guaranteed every field we request will always be resolved. Not being able to distinguish between null and unset is a problem we expect is more widespread, and to which we have found a not amazing solution that could be better if we update the spec. How do you distinguish \"unset\" from null? - How you achieve this today (not particularly elegant, but possible) - Omission from server response? (not currently spec-compliant)",

      "description": "Building a GraphQL API as a solo developer handling both the front end and back end in a single Git repository can be straightforward. However, in a real-world scenario, you will need to collaborate with other developers, both within your team and externally. There will be API consumers under your control, as well as those you might not even be aware of. If you use composite schemas (such as Federation), many teams will create their subgraphs to compose a supergraph. How can you safely evolve your schema without breaking clients? How do you prevent attackers from sending vulnerable GraphQL operations to your server? A schema registry can assist you and your team in successfully adopting GraphQL at scale. Discover how to gain analytics on your GraphQL API usage, avoid shipping breaking changes through CI/CD integrations, and prevent unwanted GraphQL operations by leveraging Persisted Documents using the open-source MIT-licensed Hive API platform specially designed for GraphQL.",

      "description": "One of the main advantages of GraphQL is that you can query for only the data you need. But in order to realize that promise for graph consumers, the schema needs to be thoughtfully designed to support data access requirements for the client apps that will query it. In this workshop, we’ll explore the process of demand-driven schema design and how a “dream query” can be reverse-engineered into a scalable and maintainable GraphQL schema that supports product use cases.\n\nWhat you’ll learn:\nCommon schema design patterns Build queries to display the data your app needs Best practices for designing client-focused queries Practical tips for schema reviews Federation / composite schemas considerations",

      "description": "As AI technologies like LLMs innovate at an accelerated pace, the importance of robust data foundations has never been greater. Traditional data architectures, designed with apps and APIs in mind, are now being pushed to their limits by the demands of advanced AI applications. This workshop will delve into principles for getting your data ready for AI. One of the main principles is having all your data and business logic under one interface - we will see how to build this using GraphQL (or SQL). We will also see how to incorporate consistent authorization so that your LLM doesn't have to worry about security. Finally, we will plumb all of this together to create a fundamentally powerful data connectivity for your AI applications.\n\nTo get the most out of this workshop, bring an Anthropic account with some credits and an Anthropic API key. You can also use OpenAI, but Anthropic is preferred.",

As we continue modernizing our frontend architecture, one major challenge is identifying what data is already available, what’s duplicated, and what’s missing entirely from the graph. Using AI, we’ve begun introspecting legacy domains to map their data structures against the schema, surface PII fields for tagging and tracking, and inform where schema design can be improved. In this talk, we’ll share how we’re using AI to support schema modernization at scale, streamline developer experience, and bring more consistency to a graph that continues to grow and change across teams.",

We do this by leveraging multiple streams of data to help make accurate decisions that minimize friction to our good customers. Enrichment of entities, for example, orders, is often distributed across multiple APIs, which makes collecting and organizing large sets of data inefficient and inflexible.\n\nTo simplify development, we built a GraphQL API to consolidate the collection and storage of data that allowed us to break the dependency on API results and design our storage around entities in a way that was optimal for our business. Chaining API calls now only takes place within a single API without need for code replication. Swapping out the underlying API for specific fields no longer requires code refactoring as the shape of the entity remained the same. The schema is well-connected which allows for different entry points but ultimately arrives at the same data without needing to reinvent the wheel.\n\nWe can now focus on developing a schema and set of entities that match our business needs, without risk of major refactoring when a dependent API changes.",

While a high level of Quality of Service is possible in other protocols such as STOMP or MQTT, there is no actual guarantee of delivery with GraphQL Subscriptions: any acknowledgment mechanism should be built in userland.\n \nWebSockets can be interrupted at any time with both graceful and ungraceful disconnections, and the lack of acknowledgment in the subscription protocol affects reliability, making GraphQL Subscription over WebSocket connections susceptible to disconnections, as any protocol failures will result in messages being lost. In other words, Subscriptions are stateful. In this talk, we will investigate a mitigation technique to make them resumable so that the connection can be destroyed and recreated without any message loss.",

As that approach matured, we saw opportunities to build a more efficient engine to support them.\n\nThis talk describes our new GraphQL engine. Key elements in our design include:\n\n- Refactoring query execution into distinct resolution and completion phases.\n\n- A query planner that optimizes and orchestrates the execution of those phases.\n\n- A new data structure that is the intermediary between the two phases, a data structure that allows for principled communication between the many resolvers involved in executing a query",

      "description": "The Member Experience Core Systems team at Netflix is entrusted with orchestrating every facet of the member experience. From the intricacies of the profiles screen to the dynamic homepage and the seamless search for your favorite shows, our robust API layer is the backbone that supports it all.\n\nOperating at an astronomical scale, our two principal Subgraph Services collectively manage over a million GraphQL queries per second. This immense scale, coupled with the diverse queries our systems accommodate, ensures that even the most minute edge cases are brought to light.\n\nIn this presentation, we will delve into two significant production bugs that emerged at scale. The first involved a federation-based solution at the query planning layer, which culminated in a 20% reduction in requests per second and yielded substantial cost savings amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The second, a subgraph service specific enhancement, remarkably doubled the efficiency of our entire fleet.\n\nBy sharing our journey of identifying and resolving these issues, we aspire to provide insights that will directly enhance your day-to-day endeavors using GraphQL.",

      "description": "You added security measures to all your subgraphs and are sure you're safe? Think again. In a federated GraphQL system, the most significant risks often hide not within individual services, but within the logic and trust assumptions of the federation layer itself.\n \nThis talk explores how federated GraphQL architectures introduce a new class of security challenges that traditional testing and validation frequently overlook. We'll walk through practical examples based on real-world use cases and both offensive and defensive insights, showing why stitching secure services together doesn’t automatically result in a secure supergraph.\n \nAttendees will see federation-specific threats in action, learn important security concepts, and walk away with actionable strategies for hardening routers, auditing configurations, and building safer service interactions. We'll also share PoC code and conceptual outlines for detection tooling to help apply these learnings in real-world systems.\n \nAn engaging, practical, and scenario-driven session - especially relevant for developers and security engineers working with federated GraphQL systems.",

We’ll share how we approached this transition—starting from an existing internal schema that wasn’t shaped for external consumers—and the steps we took to expose only what was ready. Using Apollo Federation Contracts, we filtered out unstable or sensitive parts of the graph. Along the way, we defined best practices for the public schema, like cursor-based pagination, using oneOf for inputs and results.\nWe’ll also touch on how we serve the schema through Hive Gateway with a supergraph setup, and the security measures we added, like depth limiting and complexity analysis. To keep things evolving safely, we rely on GraphQL Hive to track usage and guide deprecations.\n \nIf you’re thinking about exposing a GraphQL API—or just want ideas for keeping one clean and manageable—this talk will share what worked for us, what didn’t, and what we learned.",

We'll start by creating a robust GraphQL API using Apollo Router, covering schema design and federation best practices.\n\nThen we'll extend your GraphQL API with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling structured AI data access and tool-based interactions. This allows AI assistants to query your products, manage inventory, and process orders directly through your API.This workshop emphasizes exceptional developer experience with hot-reloading capabilities across your entire stack for rapid iteration. You'll learn real-world patterns for connecting GraphQL APIs with MCP servers, handling data flow between layers, and maintaining type safety from your database to your AI tools.\n\n<strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Familiarity with GraphQL basics. Bring a laptop with Node.js installed.\n\nBy the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:<ul><li>Configure Apollo Router to orchestrate multiple GraphQL services into a unified graph</li><li>Integrate microservices that extend and complement each other's capabilities</li><li>Build and deploy a custom GraphQL API as part of your federated graph</li><li>Expose any GraphQL operation as MCP tools with zero additional code, making your entire API instantly AI-accessible</li><li>Understand practical use cases for AI-integrated applications in modern development workflows</li></ul>",

The goal is to showcase the powerful synergy between Relay’s declarative data fetching and RSC’s server-side rendering, creating an ideal stack for scalable, performant web applications. \n \nThe demo will highlight: \n \n- Co-location of GraphQL fragments with React components for a modular, maintainable codebase. \n- Relay’s type-safe queries to efficiently fetch data for posts, comments, and user profiles. \n- React Server Components to optimize server-side rendering and enable React streaming for progressive UI rendering. \n- A fully functional social media app with interactive, real-time features. \n \nThrough this hands-on demo, we’ll illustrate how Relay’s fragment-based architecture and RSC’s streaming capabilities allow developers to build responsive, data-driven applications. This workshop will demonstrate the potential of these technologies for modern frontend development providing a compelling case for adopting this stack in production projects.",

      "description": "GraphQL error handling sucks. There, I said it.\n\nEver hunted through the errors list to figure out if a null was legit or caused by an error? If you're like me, you gave up and now treat nulls as \"maybe errored, maybe absent, maybe both.\"\n\nAnd nullability. Schema designers make anything that might fail nullable, producing partial responses when errors occur. But since anything can fail, now everything is nullable—\nand we're drowning in null checks. We recklessly cast to non-null or fall back to the empty string out of desperation. And we still don't know what's truly nullable.\n\nNo more.\n\nThis talk introduces a new, pragmatic approach, born from years of work by the Nullability WG. We propose a future where schemas reflect the true nullability of business entities, and error handling is where it belongs: in your code, not your data. Use your language's built-in tools to handle errors ergonomically; and drop the unnecessary null checks. When you read a null, it should mean one thing: the absence of data.\n\nThis isn't some distant ideal on the horizon of GraphQL's future; with just 512 bytes added to your GraphQL client, you can start adopting this today. Come see how.",

      "description": "In this workshop, we will look at different patterns to integrate various data sources in a federated graph using the Apollo Federation V2 spec, the Composite Schemas spec, WebAssembly with the recently released Component Model, and the Grafbase Gateway.\n\nGraphQL Federation is a fantastic pattern to combine APIs — called subgraphs — into a single schema while sharing types and declaratively depending from data from other subgraphs. In fact, it is too good to keep it to GraphQL subgraphs only — what if you could bring other kinds of APIs and data sources into your federated graph without having to write a dedicated GraphQL server in front of them?\n\nIn the course of the hands-on workshop, we will:<ul><li>Integrate a REST API, a Postgres database and a Kafka instance using open source extensions,</li><li>Use the gRPC extension and the MCP server to understand, integrate and query gRPC services over GraphQL,</li><li>Build a new custom extension together</li></ul>\nThe result will be a functioning GraphQL federated graph without GraphQL subgraphs, demonstrating that federation as a mechanism is useful beyond just GraphQL subgraphs.",

      "description": "Although the topic of namespacing has been brought up repeatedly in the GraphQL community over the last decade, there is an understandable worry that it would lead to anti-patterns in schema design. If namespacing is used as an excuse to avoid coordination between teams, this can result in a fragmented GraphQL schema that reflects current team boundaries as opposed to domain or client concerns.\n\nGraphQL Federation offers an alternative architecture: when coordination is enforced and consistency guaranteed, a large number of teams can contribute to a single, coherent GraphQL schema without the danger of stepping on each other's toes.\n\nEven with that architecture in place however, I believe there are still legitimate use cases for namespacing. In this talk, I will go over some of those use cases, and formulate a set of design principles that could guide the introduction of namespacing in GraphQL.",

      "description": "The GraphQL community has come together to standardize how people can build distributed systems with GraphQL as an orchestrator. In this talk I will explain the general idea that we have for GraphQL as an Orchestrator in this space and how the new specification is tackling this. We will look at the progress we have made since last GraphQL Conf in the GraphQL composite schema working group and also get some sneak peaks at our early RFCs and prototypes. I will outline how this new specification is taking the best ideas of existing solutions in the market to make the next big leap towards mainstream adoption. This will allow anyone to build tooling by implementing the spec or parts of the spec that seamlessly integrate with other vendors.",

Graffle initially grew out of my desire to have a JS GraphQL client with a fully featured and type safe document builder which I couldn’t get from tools like GenQL or Zeus at the time.\n\nGraffle is still a mostly unknown work in progress but I am ready to begin talking about it and already some early adopters have taken to giving regular feedback.

      "description": "What if your GraphQL schema could do more than provide data? What if it could help your app be more accessible from the start? In this lightning talk, we'll explore an innovative idea of embedding accessibility metadata directly into GraphQL schemas. Inspired by using Kotlin semantics in Jetpack Compose, imagine annotating fields with labels, roles, or screen reader hints that can be used to support screen readers, improve navigation, and even power automated accessibility testing. By adding custom accessibility annotations, tools could generate more accessible UI components, which enhances both the developer experience and the user experience. This is a call to rethink the developer experience and treat accessibility as a first-class concern. Let's reimagine GraphQL not just as a data layer, but as an inclusive design enabler.",

      "description": "In theory, data loaders solve most \"N+1\" problems in GraphQL. In practice, they can be hard to implement, so they’re typically used only in performance-critical situations and often reactively, once inefficiencies surface. To achieve better performance, batching needs to be applied wherever possible.\n \nThis talk introduces batch resolvers, a more developer-friendly alternative to data loaders. While traditional GraphQL resolvers take a single input and produce a single output, batching resolvers take a list of inputs and return a list of outputs. A batch resolver can simply call a batch service API without worrying about data loaders.\n \nWhen a developer provides a batch resolver, our GraphQL server automatically aggregates individual data fetches into a single call to that resolver. It can also apply heuristics to improve aggregation, for example by consolidating different selection sets for the same entity into a single input. This design not only makes application developers’ lives easier, but also allows the server to better optimize query execution by coordinating batch dispatching as part of a broader execution strategy.",

In contrast, GraphQL federation gateways need to partition the query and retrieve chunks of data from external data sources, creating new challenges. We'll present how we solved those challenges with a focus on performance.\n \nThe first, query planning, is to find the best possible plan with the multiple possibilities federation offers to unify your data and the various data sources with their requirements. We express this problem as a graph of possibilities and solve it as a Steiner Tree problem. The second challenge is performant execution. As we need to read and write overlapping chunks of the response in parallel, it's hard to be as efficient as a traditional GraphQL server writing a response iteratively with independent fields. We build an execution DAG with field dependencies, parallelizing work as much as possible without any lock on the response. We also pre-compute the expected data shape to ingest and validate incoming data into the response without any intermediate memory allocation.",

This year, we’ll discuss how to safely roll it out.\n \nYou’ve had a GraphQL codebase that weakly handled server-side errors for years. Now, you have the tools (directives, hooks, handlers, and language features) that let you treat field errors properly. However, it’s a daunting task to suddenly explode queries en-masse by flipping a switch. This move is powerful, but requires a thoughtful and data-driven approach to do safely.\n \nIn this talk we’ll cover:\n* Preparing the groundwork for migration to stricter error handling\n* Using data to make informed decisions about fragment/query behavior\n* Gating your change at a singular point\n* Scaling the rollout to a large codebase\n* How we’re approaching this rollout at Meta",

      "description": "One of the great achievements of GraphQL is composable, full-stack type safety: a strongly-typed schema, against which one writes client components, and from which minimal yet sufficient queries are generated. This seamless flow from database to UI, with immediate feedback, compile-time guarantees and great performance, represents an unmatched DevEx breakthrough.\n \nBut what if we use a full-stack client (like Isograph aims to be)? Or use a rich client in combination with a Hasura, Prisma or PostGraphile, and effectively write components against an SQL schema? Have both the GraphQL schema and its operation language become mere implementation details?\n \nIn this talk, I'll explore how GraphQL's apparent disappearance into tooling actually represents its ultimate victory. Even as GraphQL-the-syntax fades from view, its architectural innovations—fragment composability, full-stack type safety, document merging, persisted operations—become the invisible foundation of modern development.\n \nThe best way to honor this legacy isn't to protect its syntax — it's to let its principles be reborn in new forms, evolving as our tools evolve, making app development better for years to come.",

      "description": "HotelPage Service (HPS) is one of the busiest, most business-critical systems at Booking.com — originally built as a REST API with Protobufs for speed and structure. It was fast but rigid. As product demands grew and clients needed more flexibility, cracks began to show: over-fetching, unclear ownership, and slow iteration cycles.\n \nThis talk shares our real-world journey of modernizing that stack with GraphQL — not just adopting it as a new interface, but transforming how teams design schemas, collaborate across domains, and scale under load. We’ll walk through how we evolved from a proto-backed monolith to a federated GraphQL architecture — improving performance, enabling resolver ownership, and making the schema reflect real product needs.\n \nWhether you're planning a GraphQL migration or scaling one across teams, this talk delivers actionable insights and hard-won lessons from operating at billions of requests per day.\n \nAttendees will gain:\n- Align schema design with client and product needs\n- Handle organisational complexity in federation\n- Avoid pitfalls like over-fetching and the N+1 trap\n- Drive resolver ownership and collaboration\n- Optimise execution paths under high traffic",

This distinction is rarely framed as an explicit choice in GraphQL literature, with most examples showcasing the structure-first approach by default.\n\nYet this initial decision shapes everything from your team structure to how you handle breaking changes—and if you start with a structure-first approach, it's especially difficult to unwind that decision later. In this session, we'll explore the critical differences between these philosophies, examine how they manifest in real schemas, and analyze the trade-offs each approach presents. You'll see how changes that feel natural in one approach become deeply problematic in the other, and learn to identify which patterns your team has already begun to follow.",

      "description": "Plugging an LLM into GraphQL sounds simple—until it drowns in thousands of fields, types, and connections. Most models today can’t reason effectively over large APIs without brittle prompt hacks or hardcoded shortcuts.\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) is the cutting-edge solution for enabling seamless, dynamic interactions between LLMs and external tooling. It standardizes the way models interact with various tools, breaking down barriers between APIs and AI systems.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll discover how to turn any GraphQL endpoint into an MCP-compatible server with minimal overhead. Reuse your existing GraphQL infrastructure to avoid reinventing authorization, schema management, and validation enabling scalable, robust LLM integrations. We’ll compare existing tools and automated schema discovery against hand-crafted mappers based on benchmarks of public GraphQL APIs. Join us to learn about our experiences and recommendations for your next GenAI project, powered by GraphQL.",

      "description": "Pinterest is adopting GraphQL. Given our app's size, we can't simply rewrite everything in one fell swoop. So, we created the Relay Migration API (RMA) — a set of tools to incrementally migrate your React components to consume GraphQL-shaped data while making requests to REST endpoints.\n\nI'll share how we've significantly evolved the RMA after migrating four key surfaces, focusing on the advanced challenges we faced:\n\n<ul><li>RMA recreates objects on every render by default, breaking components expecting stable references. We implemented a caching layer, similar to Relay's, to return consistent objects between renders.</li><li>RMA originally read from static source objects, creating stale data when Redux state changed. Our solution: a selective subscription system that re-computes GraphQL data only when source fields change, keeping data current while eliminating unnecessary renders.</li><li>And in cases where Redux and GraphQL schemas fundamentally differ, we built bidirectional mapping with schema validation to ensure data consistency.</li></ul>\nJoin us to learn how the Relay migration API has evolved and how it helps you accelerate your GraphQL migrations without disrupting existing applications!",

      "description": "This talk will give attendees an overview of the structure of GraphQL's official organizations: The GraphQL Foundation and the GraphQL Specification Project. It will get specific about the governance and roadmaps of each organization and their specific priorities in 2025 and beyond.\n\nIn my time serving in these various institutions, I've noticed that even the most active GraphQL practitioners aren't fully aware of what they are and what they do. Attendees will learn about the GraphQL Working Group, the Technical Steering Committee, and the Foundation's Governing Board. We'll also touch upon the various technical working groups and the new Community Working Group. The talk culminates in a call to action for folks to get involved.",
